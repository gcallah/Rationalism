            <h2>
            Abstract
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Lewis Carroll is most famous, of course, for his Alice books:
                <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>Alice Through the Looking
                Glass</i>. Those works certainly display an anti-rationalist
                spirit, and we will explore them in this essay. However,
                Carroll, in his other life, was the Oxford
                mathematician and logician Charles Dodgson, and besides making
                important technical contributions to those fields, he also gave
                serious thought to their philosophical foundations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Those reflections are expressed most succinctly in his essay
                "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles," which was published in
                the philosophical journal <i>Mind</i>. At a time when formalism
                was on the rise in both mathematics and logic, Carroll wrote
                his essay to demonstrate that such formalism could never 
                capture the essential truth of logic itself: there are an
                infinite number of possible formal systems of logic, and there
                is no formalism that can help us to decide between them without
                an infinite regress. In choosing one formal system as
                preferable to another, we must of necessity rely upon our own
                sense of truth (and here we see an anticipation of Michael
                Polanyi's <i>Personal Knowledge</i>), and not another formalism.
                As the Wittgensteinian philosopher Peter Winch wrote in
                <i>The Idea of a Social
                Science and its Relation to Philosophy</i> (1958),
                Carroll showed that "the actual process of drawing an
                inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is
                something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ...
                Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about
                explicit logical relations between propositions; it is
                learning to do something" (p. 57).
            </p>

            <p>
                When we fully understand Carroll's point in the tortoise and
                Achilles essay, we see that he was a forerunner of both
                G&ouml;del and Wittgenstein in pointing out how any formal
                system must be anchored in some deeper notion of its
                significance for it to have any relevance to truth.
