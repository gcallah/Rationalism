        <h1>
            Nec Spe Nec Metu:
            Philosophic Catharsis in Karl Löwith’s Meaning in History
        </h1>

        <p>
        The philosopher Karl Löwith’s confrontation with modernity has not
        received the same level of attention as those of fellow twentieth
        century German-Jewish émigrés, Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss. This is
        regrettable, for while at times appearing only as chronicler of
        European nihilism, Löwith’s philosophic-political reflections are just
        as ambitious as those of his contemporaries. As Jürgen Habermas argues,
        Löwith intends to generate "the powerful mechanisms with which he hopes
        to set in motion a portentous change of scene from modernity to
        antiquity." For Löwith though, this change cannot be brought about a
        radical jump to classical paganism a la Nietzsche, but via a
        considered, analytical reduction of modernity to its component parts.
        Löwith’s measured subversion of the presumptions of modern philosophy
        is best displayed in his most influential work, <i>Meaning in History</i>, in
        which he argues that Enlightenment philosophies of history originate
        with the Hebrew and Christian faith in an eschatological fulfilment.
        While the moderns abandon the faith in providence, they secularize it
        into a faith in progress, attempting to find redemption for human
        beings in the historical process. An attempt that becomes ever more
        desperate and hubristic, which in turn is reflected in a growing
        franticness in modern politics as modern reason and faith in progress
        becomes further estranged from its roots. In demonstrating that modern
        philosophies of history are dependent on the theological concept of
        history as a history of fulfillment and salvation, Löwith reveals the
        impossibility of finding meaning in history on rational grounds. Thus,
        despite the pretensions of thinkers from Voltaire to Marx, they too
        reside within a horizon delimited by irrational hope and faith. By
        purging readers of the illusions of modern philosophy, Löwith’s
        catharsis makes accessible the serene rediscovery of the sober reason
        of the ancients.
