            John Gray's Agon: Liberalism, Morality, Politics
        </h1>

        <p>
        Liberalism is often justified as a means of securing basic individual
        rights. Indeed, in this capacity, it is often identified as the
        political creed of the enlightenment. In a series of publications, John
        Gray has rejected this justification of liberalism, and in so doing, as
        rejected seeing it as an enlightenment creed. Indeed, in recent times,
        he has gone so far as to reject calling his own view 'liberal.'

        <p>
        In this essay, my task is to suggest that this rejection of the label
        by Gray, while understandable, is premature. For I shall argue that we
        can see Gray's thought as squarely within what I will call a Hobbesian
        tradition of liberal thought. Moreover, I will also contend that this
        Hobbesian liberalism has the potential to generate promising strategies
        for dealing with contemporary objections to liberalism.
