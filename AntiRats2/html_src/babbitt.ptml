        Irving Babbitt (1865-1933) was a professor of comparative literature at
        Harvard, and he was at the forefront of the early twentieth century
        American New Humanism movement. He counted Nobel Prize winning poet
        T.S. Eliot among his students. He had a prominent public voice in his
        day and wrote widely on topics including imagination, higher education,
        political theory, and practical American politics. One of his enduring
        topics of concern was analyzing the ideational and imaginative
        dimensions of what he called "humanitarianism" in modern and American
        political thought and practice.

        For Babbitt, humanitarianism came in two distinct though complementary
        strains. The first he called "scientific humanitarianism" and the
        second he called "sentimental humanitarianism." Although scientific
        humanitarianism tends to place more emphasis upon rationality than the
        sentimental type, both versions are highly imaginative, that is, appeal
        to and seek to change a person’s pre-conceptual sense of how reality
        holds together and what in politics is truly possible. Both versions of
        humanitarianism reject the notion that human nature consists to some
        degree or another of permanent moral imperfection. Hence, the
        humanitarians see politics as a program, not of cultivating individual
        ethical restraint, but of emancipating humanity from its
        poorly-organized, confining, and even evil past. Scientific
        humanitarians tend to organize projects of political liberation around
        the promotion and instantiation of "scientific" or "rational"
        arrangements that maximize individual physical security and
        opportunities for material comfort. Partly in reaction to the perceived
        sterile rationality of scientific humanitarians, those of the
        sentimental type champion a transformative politics built on emotional
        and "romantic" appeals to liberty, equality, unity, and justice.
        Babbitt counted Enlightenment figures such as Francis Bacon, Thomas
        Hobbes, and John Locke as representative scientific humanitarians; he
        believed Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the first major critic of the
        Enlightenment, was the arch-typical sentimental humanitarian.

        This chapter analyzes humanitarianism as Babbitt understood it both in
        its modern and American manifestations. It also explains why Babbitt
        was deeply troubled by the theories and practical fruits associated
        with this movement. For Babbitt, humanitarians of the scientific and
        sentimental types fundamentally misunderstood the human condition and
        thus supported a politics inclined toward individual moral chaos and
        tremendous national and international violence. Most vividly in his own
        life, he believed the two pillars of humanitarianism made significant
        contributions to the outbreak and inhumane conduct of World War I. The
        ideas and imaginative disposition driving humanitarianism remain alive
        and well. Thus, understanding Babbitt’s critique of this movement in
        his own time will shed much needed light on the disorders of the
        present as well as ways to work toward a reconstitution of individual
        and social order along the lines of Babbitt’s preferred "humanistic"
        alternative to humanitarianism.
