            Social Science as Art:
            Robert Nisbet’s Defense of Traditional Sociology
        </h1>

        <p>
        The American sociologist Robert Nisbet was most famous for his critique
        of the alliance between modern statism and individualism and his
        defense of communities. But as a prominent sociologist, he also wrote
        about sociology and the social sciences more broadly as humanistic
        disciplines. Nisbet was deeply critical of the quantitative and
        rationalistic turn in sociology writing that the creative processes of
        groundbreaking social scientific work is more akin to that of an artist
        than that of the physical scientist or mathematician. In his social
        science textbooks such as <i>The Sociological Tradition</i>
        and <i>The Social Bond</i> Nisbet discusses
        the methodological aspect of sociology that
        grounds it in the humanities and arts rather than in the sciences even
        going so far as to title one book
        <i>Sociology as an Art Form</i> where he
        argues that the founding of sociology owes a lot more to the nineteenth
        century romanticism than it does to the Enlightenment and that it takes
        its scholarly forms more from art than it does from the physical
        sciences. This chapter discusses this oft-ignored aspect of Nisbet's
        work and connects his critique to that of Michael Oakshott and Michael
        Polonyi.
