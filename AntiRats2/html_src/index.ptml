            The aim of this project is to provide an overview of some
            of the most important critics of Enlightenment rationalism.
            The essays on each thinker
            are intended not merely to offer a discussion of that thinker, but
            also to place him or her in the context of this larger stream of
            anti-rationalist thought.

            Reviewers' comments on Volume I:
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                "Callahan and McIntyre have brought together a distinguished
                and cosmopolitan array of contributors who have produced a
                lively and provocative collection of essays exploring and
                analysing the modern phenomenon of Enlightenment rationalism
                whose distinguished critics range from the historically
                important Edmund Burke, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Friedrich
                Nietzsche, to our near contemporaries Hans-Georg Gadamer, Erii
                Voegelin and Michael Oakeshott. The connecting and fascinating
                thread that runs through the volume is a relentless critique of
                a style of thinking that prioritises the pursuit of certainty,
                and a blind belief in the powers of instrumental reason to
                overcome all adversity."

                <br />
                Cardiff University
            </li>

            <li>
                "This is a remarkable and remarkably comprehensive collection
                on thinkers who questioned enlightenment rationalism, both in
                the nineteenth and twentieth century. The list is impressive:
                Tocqueville, Kierkegaard, Burke, Nietzsche, Eliot, as well as
                Oakeshott, Hayek, Alasdair MacIntyre,  and a number of others
                equally stellar, and equally deep and complex. The essays are
                by accomplished scholars, and show that the opposition to
                enlightenment rationalism was both diverse and strikingly
                coherent, and a treasure trove for thinking beyond the
                enlightenment. It will be especially valuable for those with
                interests in one of these thinkers to see them in the context
                of the larger fraternity to which they belong."

                "This volume could not have arrived at a better time. McIntyre
                and Callahan have given us an excellent set of essays that
                speaks directly to the fetishization of human reason. Each of
                the thinkers examined reminds us of the fallibility of human
                beings — a lesson we sorely need to revisit every generation or
                so."
