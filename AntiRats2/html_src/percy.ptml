        Walker Percy's anti-rationalism issues forth from his concern with
        abstraction. Percy discerned what he took to be a distinctively
        twentieth-century (peculiarly Western) form of disquieted
        consciousness—a miasmic malaise—consisting in a loss of the self,
        brought about by fivefold  inextricably linked phenomena: (a) first and
        foremost by our inherited bifurcated Cartesian self,  and,
        derivatively, (b) an uncritical assimilation and extension of
        scientific a priorism, pejoratively known as scientism; (c) an
        atomistic social abstraction in the form of homo economicus, i.e.
        formalized rational maximizers; (d) the salvatory rationalism promised
        to  consumers of ideas be it junk science, conspiracy theories, New Age
        movements, cults, gurus, fundamentalism, evangelicalism, zealotry of
        all kinds — that can be institutionalized as political, religious, or
        even academic charlatanism; and (e) a loss of a sense of place corroded
        by the ongoing creep of cultural homogeneity that has undermined the
        situated agent.
