                George Eliot's Critiques of Rationalism

        George Eliot's 1856 translation of Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i> was finally
        published in 2019. It draws scholarly attention to her role at the
        forefront of the English reception of continental rationalism. Before
        she became the famous Victorian novelist, Eliot was an active member of
        the Rosehill Circle, and made the first translations of David Strauss,
        Ludwig Feuerbach, and Baruch Spinoza into English. However, the growing
        appreciation of Eliot's philosophical career throws the themes of her
        novels in sharp relief, since Eliot's critical responses to triumphal
        atheism and the moral benefits of scientific progress run throughout
        her novels. In <i>Silas Marner</i> (1861),
        her masterpiece <i>Middlemarch</i> (1872),
        and other novels, narrators intone, and characters discover that
        scientific advancement cannot overcome the role of chance in human
        affairs. For this reason, they realize, time-honored moral and
        religious beliefs can neither be completely rationalized nor rendered
        obsolete.
