        The intensifying political polarization in America and the West has led
        to a radical splintering of the social fabric. It has become
        increasingly clear that a reassessment of the Enlightenment concept of
        reason, that for so long has dominated our belief about what ultimately
        motivates people, may be in order.

            To understand the abiding political divisions in the West,
            highlighted in the diametrically opposed contemporary political
            movements of populist nationalism and democratic socialism, it is
            necessary to reevaluate the rationalist epistemology and to
            consider another epistemological framework for thinking about the
            limits and possibilities of politics. One of the first thinkers to
            oppose Cartesian rationalism, the lifeblood of Enlightenment
            thinking, and to offer a thoroughgoing philosophical
            counterargument was Giambattista Vico (1668-1744). From the
            perspective of Italian civic humanism, Vico argues that the
            imagination, rather than reason, is responsible not only for the
            development of culture and civilization but also our ability to
            know with certainty—following the project of Descartes—the nature
            of human existence. The considerable epistemological and
            philosophical insights of this eighteenth-century Neapolitan
            thinker can help us to understand the origins in the imagination of
            meaningful political division and also point toward the possibility
            of a more robust democratic pluralism through effective use of the
            imagination in the form of eloquence and wit.
