        Faith in reason as the faculty by which man can ascertain and judge
        reality is dependent upon the assumption of a morally rational world.
        According to Max Weber, this faith in the power of reason manifested
        itself in Western intellectual history in the successive hopes of
        reason as "'the path to true being,' 'the path to true art,' 'the path
        to true nature,' 'the path to true God,' and 'the path to true
        happiness'". One after the other each path failed to produce the
        expected results.

        Weber writes that if we wish to understand why reason is impotent in
        the tasks set before it in the age of reason we must first admit that
        experiential reality discloses to us a world that is morally
        irrational. The consequence of this proposition, which Weber argues is
        empirically verifiable, is that a corrective to our understanding of
        reason is urgently needed. This is the meaning of Weber's
        oft-misunderstood facts-values distinction: it is a call to acknowledge
        the limits of reason as the unique faculty by which man can judge
        reality.

        Weber's robust criticism of reason is sometimes interpreted to mean
        that he is a champion of moral nihilism. This is not the case.
        Unfortunately, despite a renewed interested in Weber scholarship in the
        last two decades, Weber's moral philosophy continues to be neglected.
        Weber argues that reason must be supplemented with the decisive factor
        in the acquisition of knowledge: a well-formed character. For Weber,
        character is chiefly made up of an "iron-clad will," but also a
        historically formed imagination and ethics. Weber's insights into the
        appropriate use of reason have the potential to be highly edifying in
        an age when much confusion on this subject remains.
