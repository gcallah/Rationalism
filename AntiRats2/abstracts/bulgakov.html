        One of the most famous Russian writers of the 20th century, Mikhail
        Bulgakov has been surprisingly neglected by political theorists. In
        this paper I attempt to rectify that by studying how he treats the
        issues of determinism and rationalism in his fiction, with a particular
        focus upon <i>The Master and Margarita</i>; <i>The Heart of a Dog</i>;
        and <i>The Fatal Eggs</i>.
        By exploring the allegorical elements of these works I will
        argue that Bulgakov dramatizes the limits of a scientific approach to
        politics that is ideologically driven. I will also argue that although
        his work is specifically written as a critique of the Soviet Union, the
        literary aspects of these stories causes them to transcend their
        original context and provide a more universal account of what the
        deeper springs of human behavior are.
