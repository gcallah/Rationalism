        This chapter will reconstruct the main lines of Pascal’s critique and
        correction of Descartes’ conception of reason.  As understood by
        Pascal, Descartes conceived of reason as being independent of all other
        belief-forming faculties, including the senses, custom, tradition, and
        divine revelation.  This has been called autonomous reason.  Pascal
        argues that such a conception of reason is self-defeating and thus
        impossible to consistently implement.  He is careful to insist,
        however, that his criticism of autonomous reason is not irrational, but
        in fact conforms to a more holistic account of what it means to be
        rational.  Pascal’s epistemology is bound up with his view that human
        nature is characterized by a fundamental duality of greatness and
        wretchedness, such that neither complete ignorance or absolute
        knowledge is our lot.  This middle position rejects fideism as well as
        autonomous reason.  The final section will draw out the political
        import of his epistemological vision.  Cartesian rationalism lays the
        groundwork for political rationalism, so it is not surprising to see in
        the few fragments Pascal devoted to political themes a criticism of
        overly-rationalist conceptions of law, justice, and political order.
        In them he begins to sketch a politics that eschews the rationalist
        drive for certainty and universality.  The enlightenment goal of first
        principles of justice is not only impossible, Pascal argues, but will
        leave political societies vulnerable to revolution and disorder once
        rationalist aspirations have undermined traditional modes of political
        authority

        This chapter will contribute to the scholarly understanding of Pascal
        in two distinct ways. First, while my depiction of Pascal’s
        epistemology will be roughly in line with existing accounts, there are
        two recent books that attempt to modify how we think about Pascal as a
        philosopher. My chapter will weigh their respective arguments and
        modifications in order to determine the manner in which they can be
        incorporated into Pascal’s broader epistemology. Second, this chapter
        will develop Pascal’s political theory to a greater extent than has so
        far been done. Most philosophical attention to Pascal has focused on
        his epistemology or theology; I will attempt to formalize his political
        teaching and, in particular, clarify the way in which it follows from
        his epistemology and anthropology.
