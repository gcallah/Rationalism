        <h1>
            Carl Schmitt's Exceptional Critique of Rationalism
        </h1>

        Carl Schmitt (1888-1985) is one of the major political theorists of the
        twentieth century. For him, 'rationalism' was not a keyword. But he was
        certainly critical of the enlightenment tradition of political
        reflection, and found much in what we now consider reactionary thinkers
        like Joseph de Maistre and Donoso Cortes. Schmitt's political
        theory—though elaborated in many different directions—is fundamentally
        about the importance of recognising that politics and law cannot be
        understood in terms of norms. Not only does politics require an
        awareness of what Schmitt abstracted and called 'the exception': it is,
        in his <i>Concept of the Political</i>,
        constituted by it. The binary of <i>norm</i>
        and <i>exception</i> is fundamental to Schmitt. It was the basis of his
        relentless critique of Hans Kelsen's theory of law. He argued that it
        was 'rationalism to say that the exception proves nothing and that only
        the normal can be the object of scientific interest. The exception
        confounds the unity and order of the rationalist scheme'. As such, his
        own theory was a critique of rationalism.
        </p>

        <p>
        In this chapter we shall characterise the exact nature of this critique
        of rationalism. It bears no resemblance to Oakeshott's critique of
        rationalism, for instance. Oakeshott took rationalism to be one style
        of politics—planning in terms of ideologies abstracted from a
        tradition—as opposed to another style—enjoying, exploring and defending
        one's tradition. But the style of politics Oakeshott wanted to defend
        against what he called 'rationalism'—politics as conversation—was in
        effect condemned by Schmitt as just another form of 'rationalism'.
        Against an immanentist political style of peaceful conversation,
        Schmitt counterposed what he thought was more fundamental: a
        transcendental vision of a politics based on the perpetual possibility
        of fundamental conflict—which meant not mere political struggle in an
        everyday sense but the Hobbesian possibility of the entire system being
        dissolved, and which required in turn that the system itself be
        grounded not on what is normal, immanent to that system, but
        exceptional, transcendental to that system. In one aspect, this gave
        Schmitt his theory of the sovereign, as developed most clearly in
        <i>Political Theology</i>; but it also gave him a very deep and marked
        hostility to modern thought in its preference for the normal over the
        exceptional and the immanent over the transcendent.
