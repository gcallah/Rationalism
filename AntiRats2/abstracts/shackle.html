The English economist G.L.S. Shackle was an important heterodox thinker who
was influenced by and influenced both Keynesians and Austrians. 
He was a student of F.A. Hayek at the LSE, at careful reader of Keynes, and
close colleague of Ludwig Lachmann.
His importance for our story is his sharp criticisms of the formalistic,
"rational" methods adopted by the economic mainstream.
This paper will examine Shackle's anti-rationalism, and attempt to set it in
the context of other anti-rationalist thinkers' work.
