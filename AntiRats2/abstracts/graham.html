        This essay examines the views of the 20th century
        sinologist/philosopher A.C. Graham on the differences between
        anti-rationalism and irrationalism, and obviously, rationalism as well.
        Although Graham draws upon the insights of the classic Doaist work,
        Zhuangzi, as inspiration, he does not make very much of this comparison
        explicitly, not wanting (one assumes) to detract from his philosophical
        argument in <i>Reason and Spontaneity</i> (1985), his major philosophic work.
        Although this  work draws comparisons and contrasts far and wide to
        make a case for what Graham calls "aware spontaneity" as the most
        appropriate human mixture of reason and unreflective impulse, this
        short essay will focus on the differences between what Graham calls the
        "Reason as Guide" approach (e.g.,Zhuangzi and Graham) and the "Reason
        as Master" approach (Kant, Descartes, Plato) to action, with both
        distinguished from the Romantic irrationalist approach cultivating
        spontaneous impulse for its sheer intensity (de Sade, Nietzsche). This
        would seem a most fitting subject for this series of studies in
        Enlightenment criticism, and, in conclusion, will very briefly note
        similarities between Graham’s and Oakeshott’s critiques of rationalism
        (the latter of whose views I examined in the first volume of this
        edited work).
