<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Blaise Pascal</em> (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicists, philosopher, and theologian. Tyler Chamberlain argues that it is important to understand Pascal as adopting a middle ground between the extreme scepticism of Montaigne and the rationalism of Descartes. Both of their positions forward a half-truth: in man's fallen state, his reason is indeed limited, as Montaigne notes... but not obliterated, which means Descartes is not wrong to defend its use. But each position fails to acknowledge the truth of the other one. Chamberlain argues that, to arrive at a true picture of the human condition, we must assert both truths simultaneously. While doing so, he debunks efforts to portray Pascal as adopting these positions as successive moments in a dialectial movement: no, Chamberlain argues, we don't really understand Pascal unless we reject that view.</p>
