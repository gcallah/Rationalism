<p><em>Blaise Pascal</em> (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicists, philosopher, and theologian. Tyler Chamberlain argues that it is important to understand Pascal as adopting a middle ground between the extreme scepticism of Montaigne and the rationalism of Descartes. Both of their positions forward a half-truth: in man's fallen state, his reason is indeed limited, as Montaigne notes... but not obliterated, which means Descartes is not wrong to defend its use. But each position fails to acknowledge the truth of the other one. Chamberlain argues that, to arrive at a true picture of the human condition, we must assert both truths simultaneously. While doing so, he debunks efforts to portray Pascal as adopting these positions as successive moments in a dialectial movement: no, Chamberlain argues, we don't really understand Pascal unless we reject that view.</p>
<p><em>Giambattista Vico</em> (1668-1744) was a Neopolitan philosopher of history. Vico was somewhat obscure during his lifetime, but gained renown as his most important work, <em>Scienza Nuova</em> (<em>The New Science</em>), came to be admired by a diverse group of thinkers including Karl Marx, R.G. Collingwood, Benedetto Croce, James Joyce, Eric Voegelin, and Marshall McLuhan.</p>
<p><em>George Eliot</em> (1819-1880) was the fiction-writing pen name of Mary Ann Evans. Under her birth name, she established herself as an important translator, editor, and critic. As George Eliot, she wrote some of the most important novels in English literature, including <em>Silas Marner</em> and <em>Middlemarch</em>. She was a careful student of the work of Spinoza, and embraced many rationalist ideas. But, as Rob Wyllie shows in his contribution, she was a cautious rationalist, who rejected many of the most radical rationalist propositions. In particular, she was sceptical of rationalist schemes for rebuilding human social life from the ground up, as she understood them to ignore the ineradicable influence of traditions and customs on human social behavior.</p>
<p><em>Fyodor Dostoevsky</em> (1821-1881) was a Russian novelist and essayist, and is often regarded as one of the most significant writers in world literature.</p>
<p><em>Max Weber</em> (1864-1920)</p>
<p><em>Mikhail Bulgakov</em> (1891-1940)</p>
<p><em>J.R.R. Tolkein</em> (1892-1973) wrote some of the best-selling novels of the last century, as well as being a professor of English language and literature at Oxford. In his chapter on Tolkein, Nathanael Blake shows how a current of anti-rationalism, informed by Tolkein's Catholic understanding of humans as finite creatures with limited understanding, ran throughout the author's work.</p>
