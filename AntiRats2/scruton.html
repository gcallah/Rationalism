        <h1>
        Roger Scruton on Reason, Rationality and the Reasonable
        </h1>

        <p>
        Ferenc Hörcher
        </p>

        <p>
        The late Sir Roger Scruton was aware , what an unduly difficult job it
        is to circumscribe the realm of conservative political thought.
        Conservatism escapes the dogmatic clarity and science-inspired
        rationality of modern ideologies. However, having been brought up in
        the analytical tradition of philosophy, he was desperate to delineate
        the conceptual structure of this edifice. This chapter is going to
        focus on Scruton’s emphasis on the inherent difficulties of
        philosophical reason when confronting the phenomenon of the political
        from a conservative standpoint.
        </p>

        <p>
        First, based on his own recollections, a biographical background will
        be offered, to show why Scruton thought that it was for him a rational
        choice to abandon progressive ideology in May 1968 in Paris, and turn
        towards conservatism. Than the inherent tensions of his own brand of
        conservatism will be analysed: his alliances both to Kantian
        rationalism and to the Burkean criticism of Enlightened rationality.
        The second half of the chapter will show how Scruton distinguished the
        Aristotelian moral affirmation of rationality, from the rational
        morality of Kant, and how he argued that in the socio-political world,
        individual rationality should often yield to manners, custom and
        institutions. The conclusion will be that Scruton remained a modernist,
        a Kantian and an individualist, even if he admitted that these features
        need to be counterpoised by classical values/virtues, Aristotelianism
        and by the "we" of social membership.
