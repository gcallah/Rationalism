        <h1>
            Bernard Williams's Critique Of Rationalism In Ethics
        </h1>

        <p>
        Bernard Williams was a moral philosopher, though he did not practice
        moral philosophy in the traditional sense especially from 1980s
        onwards. Under the influence of the so-called historical turn in the
        social sciences, he grew rather increasingly sceptical of "the ideas of
        rationality embodied in most contemporary moral philosophy" (Williams,
        2011: xvi). In particular, he found both utilitarian and Kantian
        approaches to moral philosophy unable to provide an adequate (i.e.
        realistic) answer to what he thought one of the most important
        questions for (moral) philosophy to attempt to answer: "How should one
        live?" (Williams, 2011: 1) Guided by, what Williams considered, an
        excessively ambitious promise to provide a "theory" to guide ethical
        reasoning, much of moral philosophy, he thought, depended on a too
        robust (i.e. unrealistic) theory of human agency and rationality. As a
        result, numerous theories that have been proposed in this register
        have, in practice, only contributed to increasing the gulf between
        (moral) philosophy and ethical practice, despite their original promise
        to be action-guiding.
        </p>

        <p>
        Williams shared with much of analytical philosophy the concern for
        philosophy's relevance to moral and political practice. As I have
        already stated, he considered it an important task for philosophy to
        attempt to answer Socrates's question: "How should one live?" Yet, he
        thought that to be able to do so successfully philosophy must set out
        not from a rationalistic but from a realistic account of the powers,
        skills, concerns and interests of real human agents. Importantly,
        however, taking human agents as they are, does not, for Williams, issue
        in fatalism: that is, complete resignation in the face of existing
        reality. On the contrary, for him it only leads to a more chastened and
        realistic understanding of the powers of (moral) philosophy. Instead of
        attempting to provide a "theory" to guide ethical reasoning, he
        suggested that philosophy should attempt to identify what "makes sense"
        for real human agents to believe and to do in their given their
        historical, material conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
        This chapter will first present William's critique of rationalism in
        ethics and, then, consider his suggestion for a more limited role for
        philosophy in terms of what he termed as "making sense". The aim of the
        chapter is both to reflect on Williams as a philosopher critical of a
        particular understanding of rationality and to contribute to recent
        debates on political realism, where Williams figures as one of the key
        progenitors.
