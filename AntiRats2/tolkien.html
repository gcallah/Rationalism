        <h1>
            J.R.R. Tolkien: Tales Against Domination
        </h1>

        <p>
        J.R.R. Tolkien's epic <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy,
        along with the lighter <i>Hobbit</i> prequel,
        are among the most beloved books of the last century.
        They have sold hundreds of millions of copies and defined the fantasy
        genre for decades, with a literary quality far superior to their many
        imitators. The <i>Lord of the Rings</i> has become a cultural icon with broad
        appeal, whose fans range from hippies to conservative Catholics, but
        this does not arise from the books being mere escapism. Tolkien's work
        provided a compelling, if subtle, counternarrative to the claims of
        scientism and rationalism that dominated much of the 20th century.
        </p>

        <p>
        This goes deeper that Tolkien's fondness for forests and distaste for
        mechanization. The great evils in his stories are defined by their
        desire to dominate and control, subjugating the weak to their ends.
        Thus, the chief moral struggle in his work is not the physical war
        against the unabashed evil of the Dark Lord and his monsters. Rather it
        is in the hearts of those who are tempted to join with that evil, or to
        adopt its methods and mindset of domination. Tolkien's work is not a
        warning against power as such, but against domination. And rationalism
        (as distinct from reason) is a means and excuse for this unjust
        dominion. It is an attempt by the intellect to grasp the whole of
        reality, and thereby bring it under control. Temptation to this may
        begin from a desire to do good, but this is perverted by the arrogant
        assumption of control.
        </p>

        <p>
        Tolkien did not lay this out with heavy-handed allegory or didacticism;
        he wanted to tell stories, not put crude speeches into the mouths of
        his characters. But his moral and philosophical outlook did inform his
        work, which in turn has shaped the imaginative vision of many readers.
        In the world of literature, Tolkien's tales have been a citadel
        standing against rationalist domination.
