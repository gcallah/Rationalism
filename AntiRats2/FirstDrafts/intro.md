# Critics of Enlightenment Rationalism Revisited


## Introduction


*Blaise Pascal* (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicists, philosopher, and
theologian. Tyler Chamberlain argues that it is important to understand Pascal
as adopting a middle ground between the extreme scepticism of Montaigne and the
rationalism of Descartes. Both of their positions forward a half-truth: in
man's fallen state, his reason is indeed limited, as Montaigne notes... but not
obliterated, which means Descartes is not wrong to defend its use. But each
position fails to acknowledge the truth of the other one. Chamberlain argues
that, to arrive at a true picture of the human condition, we must assert both
truths simultaneously. While doing so, he debunks efforts to portray Pascal as 
adopting these positions as successive moments in a dialectial movement: no,
Chamberlain argues, we don't really understand Pascal unless we reject that
view.

*Giambattista Vico* (1668-1744) was a Neopolitan philosopher of history. Vico
was somewhat obscure during his lifetime, but gained renown as his most
important work, *Scienza Nuova* (*The New Science*), came to be admired by a
diverse group of thinkers including Karl
Marx, R.G. Collingwood, Benedetto Croce, James Joyce, Eric Voegelin, and
Marshall McLuhan.

*George Eliot* (1819-1880) was the fiction-writing pen name of Mary Ann Evans.
Under her birth name, she established herself as an important translator,
editor, and critic. As George Eliot, she wrote some of the most important
novels in English literature, including *Silas Marner* and *Middlemarch*.
She was a careful student of the work of Spinoza, and embraced many
rationalist ideas. But, as Rob Wyllie shows in his contribution, she was a
cautious rationalist, who rejected many of the most radical rationalist
propositions. In particular, she was sceptical of rationalist schemes for
rebuilding human social life from the ground up, as she understood them to
ignore the ineradicable influence of traditions and customs on human social
behavior.

*Fyodor Dostoevsky* (1821-1881) was a Russian novelist and essayist, and is
often regarded as one of the most significant writers in world literature.

*Max Weber* (1864-1920) is often considered the founder of modern sociology.
His work *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* is one of the
great works of social science. In her essay on Weber, Lucie Miryekta argues
that, contra the common view, Weber was not a rationalist, but, rather, was
setting out the limits of instrumental reason, in order to demonstrate that
human life demands more.


*Irving Babbitt* (1865-1933) was an American literary critic.

*Carl Schmitt* (1888-1985) is one of the most controversial figures in the
history of political thought. It has been difficult for his commentators to
separate his insights about the political condition from his support of Nazism
in the 1930s.  Gulsen Seven and Aylin Ã–zman do an exemplary job pulling apart
these two facets of Schmitt, so that we can appreciate his critique of
political rationalism on its own merits.


*Mikhail Bulgakov* (1891-1940) 

*J.R.R. Tolkein* (1892-1973) wrote some of the best-selling novels of the last century,
as well as being a professor of English language and literature at Oxford. In
his chapter on Tolkein, Nathanael Blake shows how a current of
anti-rationalism, informed by Tolkein's Catholic understanding of humans as
finite creatures with limited understanding, ran throughout the author's work.

*Karl Lowith* (1897-1973)

*Owen Barfield* (1898-1997) was a philosopher and poet. As a member of the
Inklings, he was a friend of both J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis. 

*Gregory Bateson* (1904-1980) was an English anthropologist


*Robert Nisbet* (1913-1996) was an American sociologist...

*Elizabeth Anscombe* (1919-2001) was an English philosopher and protege of
Ludwig Wittgenstein.

*A.C. Graham* (1919-1991) was a Welsh sinologist...
