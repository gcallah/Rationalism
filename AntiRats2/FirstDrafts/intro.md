# Critics of Enlightenment Rationalism Revisited


## Introduction


*Blaise Pascal* (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicists, philosopher, and
theologian. Tyler Chamberlain argues that it is important to understand Pascal
as adopting a middle ground between the extreme scepticism of Montaigne and the
rationalism of Descartes. Both of their positions forward a half-truth: in
man's fallen state, his reason is indeed limited, as Montaigne notes... but not
obliterated, which means Descartes is not wrong to defend its use. But each
position fails to acknowledge the truth of the other one. Chamberlain argues
that, to arrive at a true picture of the human condition, we must assert both
truths simultaneously. While doing so, he debunks efforts to portray Pascal as 
adopting these positions as successive moments in a dialectial movement: no,
Chamberlain argues, we don't really understand Pascal unless we reject that
view.

*Giambattista Vico* (1668-1744) was a Neopolitan philosopher of history. Vico
was somewhat obscure during his lifetime, but gained renown as his most
important work, *Scienza Nuova* (*The New Science*), came to be admired by a
diverse group of thinkers including Karl
Marx, R.G. Collingwood, Benedetto Croce, James Joyce, Eric Voegelin, and
Marshall McLuhan.



*J.R.R. Tolkein* (1892-1973) wrote some of the best-selling novels of the last century,
as well as being a professor of English language and literature at Oxford. In
his chapter on Tolkein, Nathanael Blake shows how a current of
anti-rationalism, informed by Tolkein's Catholic understanding of humans as
finite creatures with limited understanding, ran throughout the author's work.
