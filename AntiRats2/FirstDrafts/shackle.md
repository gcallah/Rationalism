# The Kaleidic Economics of G.L.S. Shackle


## Introduction

The English economist G. L. S. Shackle was an important heterodox thinker who
was influenced by and influenced both Keynesians and Austrians. 
He was a student of F.A. Hayek at the LSE, at careful reader of Keynes, and
close colleague of Ludwig Lachmann.
His importance for our story is his sharp criticisms of the formalistic,
"rational" methods adopted by the economic mainstream.


## Business, Time and Thought

One of the centerpieces of the rationalist project has been the effort to lift
morality from the realms of tradition and revelation and turn moral choice into
a matter of calculation based on "rational" criteria. The most famous of those
endeavors is utilitarianism, championed by Bentham, the father and son Mills,
Henry Sidgwick, and modern adherents such as Peter Singer.

Shackle's analysis of the meaning of "possibility" in the context of choice is
devastating to the notion that utilitarianism offers a rational means of
deciding ethical conundrums. He notes that the chooser cannot possibly assign
meaningful probabilities to all potential outcomes of a choice, since:

"[A]ny such skein of the imagined sequels of some one action must be deemed
always incomplete and uncompleteable. The mutual rivalry alone of the members
of any skein would obscure the meaning of the assignment of degrees of positive
confidence... in the members. Their liability in principle to an indefinite
extension of their numbers seems to destroy any such meaning." (p. 13)

If the utilitarian moralist cannot even conceivably imagine all of the possible
outcomes of her potential action, let alone assign a meaningful probability to
all of them, how can she possibly calculate the probable utility gained or lost
by choosing to so act? In practice, this usually means the utilitarian can just
declare that they have done the calculation, and do what they wanted to do
anyway: "If I don't sleep with my friend's wife, she'll probably leave him, and
that would be much worse for the kids, so..."



"I have to express the conviction that this great arabesque of brilliant
intellectual endeavor has still the same essential purpose: to eliminate the
true unknowledge which gives us imaginative freedom" (p. 14)




"Language, after all, is essentially, irremediably imprecise, its words and
phrases capacious for richly various meanings, a medium immeasurably more
powerful in suggestion than in mere assertion" (p. 15)



"In the ever-changing world which Marshall pointed to, the representation of a
firms market by a demand-curve is no more than an aid to thought. It has
invaluable suggestions to make" (p. 17)


Shackle also argued that "rationalism in trading" (he did not use those words!)
was not possible:

"Can a dealer calculate what will take place? To think he can is wildly to
deceive himself. He has some impressions. He may even call them data. There can
be no knowing what other data are in the pack waiting to be dealt, or can yet
be put into it by human ingenious ploys... All experience... tells him that the
statement of [his trade's] conditions, that he has in mind, are bound to be
mere fragments" (p. 19)



In an essay praising Cantillon, Shackle points out that, in the 1700s,
Cantillon had already anticipated Keynes on unemployment. Those arguing against
the possibility of involuntary unemployment had argued that workers would be
paid their marginal product, which, naturally, would keep their wages adjusted
to any level of business activity:

"For how can he know what is their marginal product, when he cannot know at
what price he will be able to sell what they produce?" (p. 48)


Discussing Hayek's work on *The Pure Theory of Capital*, Shackle dismisses the
idea that science is pure ratiocination, disparate from emotion and belief:

"There must be some inspirational idea... before a man can gather the moral and
nervous force which such a [scientific] task requires. He must be seized by a
faith." (p. 184)

## Epistemics and Economics

"Rational general equilibrium owed its encompassing completeness, exactness and
certitude to its neglect of all that is essentially implied by *time*. The
rational, sure and pre-reconciled world is timeless" (p. xv).

Shackle offers an historical explanation of how economics went astray:

"When the time came to invent economic theory, a number of established, exact
and thoroughly explored modes and schemes of thought were ready to hand... The
procedure of invention was often to accept some such self-suggesting analogy
and make the economic questions fit it..." (p. 3).

But to adopt such a mode of thought from say, physics, and apply it to
economics, meant ignoring a central aspect of economic action: the uncertainty
of the future. As Shackle put it:

"the natural, inevitable and irremediable insufficiency of what is at any
moment known was assumed away and largely neglected." (p. 3).


Early in this work, Shackle dismisses the claim that science is a specially
privileged form of knowing:

"Science tells us what to count on, what rely on. But in doing so it merely
imitates and refines the process by which we build, each of us for himself, the
homely technology of every day living" (p. 6).
