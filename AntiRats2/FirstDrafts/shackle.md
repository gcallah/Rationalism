# The Kaleidic Economics of G.L.S. Shackle


## Introduction

The English economist G. L. S. Shackle was an important heterodox thinker who
was influenced by and influenced both Keynesians and Austrians. His importance
for our story is his sharp criticisms of the formalistic, "rational" methods
adopted by the economic mainstream.


## Business, Time and Thought

Discussing Hayek's work on *The Pure Theory of Capital*, Shackle dismisses the
idea that science is pure ratiocination, disparate from emotion and belief:

"There must be some inspirational idea... before a man can gather the moral and
nervous force which such a [scientific] task requires. He must be seized by a
faith." (p. 184)

## Epistemics and Economics

"Rational general equilibrium owed its encompassing completeness, exactness and
certitude to its neglect of all that is essentially implied by *time*. The
rational, sure and pre-reconciled world is timeless" (p. xv).

Shackle offers an historical explanation of how economics went astray:

"When the time came to invent economic theory, a number of established, exact
and thoroughly explored modes and schemes of thought were ready to hand... The
procedure of invention was often to accept some such self-suggesting analogy
and make the economic questions fit it..." (p. 3).

But to adopt such a mode of thought from say, physics, and apply it to
economics, meant ignoring a central aspect of economic action: the uncertainty
of the future. As Shackle put it:

"the natural, inevitable and irremediable insufficiency of what is at any
moment known was assumed away and largely neglected." (p. 3).


Early in this work, Shackle dismisses the claim that science is a specially
privileged form of knowing:

"Science tells us what to count on, what rely on. But in doing so it merely
imitates and refines the process by which we build, each of us for himself, the
homely technology of every day living" (p. 6).
