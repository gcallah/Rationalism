# The Kaleidic Economics of G.L.S. Shackle


## Introduction

The English economist G. L. S. Shackle was an important heterodox thinker who
was influenced by and influenced both Keynesians and Austrians. His importance
for our story is his sharp criticisms of the formalistic, "rational" methods
adopted by the economic mainstream.


## Epistemics and Economics

"Rational general equilibrium owed its encompassing completeness, exactness and
certitude to its neglect of all that is essentially implied by *time*. The
rational, sure and pre-reconciled world is timeless" (p. xv).

Shackle offers an historical explanation of how economics went astray:

"When the time came to invent economic theory, a number of established, exact
and thoroughly explored modes and schemes of thought were ready to hand... The
procedure of invention was often to accept some such self-suggesting analogy
and make the economic questions fit it..." (p. 3).

But to adopt such a mode of thought from say, physics, and apply it to
economics, meant ignoring a central aspect of economic action: the uncertainty
of the future. As Shackle put it:

"the natural, inevitable and irremediable insufficiency of what is at any
moment known was assumed away and largely neglected." (p. 3).
