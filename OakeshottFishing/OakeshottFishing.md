# Michael Oakeshott Goes Fishing


"Oakeshott... liked binaries, needed them, in fact."
-- James Alexander, "An Interview with Robert Grant"


## Introduction

Michael Oakeshott did indeed like binaries. Perhaps we can even go so far as to
say he needed them. And he presented us with a number of them: rationalism
versus practical understanding, the politics of faith versus the politics of
skepticism, enterprise association versus civil association, and so on. (More on this below.)

What are we to make of this plethora of binaries? This paper suggests that we
can best understand them with a metaphor Oakeshott employs in *On Human
Conduct*, that of the theorist "dropping anchor" and catching the fish
available at a certain locale reached in the enterprise of theorizing.

Once we comprehend this metaphor, we can see Oakeshott positing these various
dichotomies neither as evidence of his deciding an earlier dichotomy was wrong
or useless, but failing to describe his mistake, nor of him merely saying the
same thing using different terminology. Rather, what Oakeshott is doing in each
instance is "dropping anchor" at a different place out on the theoretic sea,
and seeing what fish he might catch from that spot.


## The Dichotomies

Let's attempt to set down the dichotomies Oakeshott, at one time or another, employs, knowing that we may miss
some:

- Exerience without reservation or arrest versus modal experience
- Aesthetic morality versus rule-bound morality
- The politics of faith versus the politics of skepticism
- Rationalism versus *phronesis*
- The individual versus the individual manque
- Civil association versus enterprise association
- Nomocracy versus teleocracy

(The above list is similar but not identical to that offered by Fuller, 2024: 280.)


## Misapprehending the Dichotomies

Let us take a look at some of the ways in which various writers have misapprehended the relationship of these binaries.
In general, these fall into groupings: Some writers suggest that OSHA was merely generating new names for the same poles
in an opposition, while others believe he was "abandoning" some now obsolete categorization and replacing it with a
new and improved one.

In the first category we find, for example, David Spitz, who claims:

"Unfortunately, *On Human Conduct*... gives no answers at all [to critiques of Oakeshott's earlier work]...
*On Human Conduct* is but a restatement of his teaching... it is no more than a linguistic variation on familiar themes...
Throughout, of course, there are the usual denunciations of Rationalism" (1976: 342-343).

Spitz is so set on seeing Oakeshott as just spinning off variations on the "same old song" that he never notices that
there are *no* denunciations of rationalism in that book. Oakeshott himself quite explicitly states the "civil versus
enterprise association" dichotomy is *not* just new terms for the "rationalism versus phronesis" dichotomy in his
response to Spitz: "in fact the word [Rationalism] is never used, and what it stands for is
never mentioned; I am concerned with something else" (1976: 357).

(In other words, he has dropped anchor at a new fishing locale, and is no longer using the "rationalism"
and "phronesis" hooks and nets.)


Elizabeth Corey is much more sympathetic to Oakeshott than is Spitz, but commits a similar error. She writes,
"This is what Oakeshott describes as the 'politics of skepticism' and 'civil association'" (156).

This remark posits the 'politics of skepticism' and 'civil association' as two names for the same thing. But if
that is so, then the 'politics of faith' and 'enterprise association' must similarly be synonyms.
But they clearly aren't: not everyone opening a corner deli (an enterprise association)
"posits a uniform condition of mundane perfection" (Corey, 172). But it would nevertheless be a mistake for the deli
owner to organize his business on a rationalist basis.

Oakeshott himself explicitly rejects this equating of enterprise association with something undesirable (such as
rationalism): "[Wolin ascribes to me a] denigration of purposive association, which is nowhere to be found in what I
have written" (1976: 362).

Oakeshott recognizes that character of the modern European state contains a mingling of the ideal types of 
civil and enterprise association. To attempt to design a polity as a "pure" civil association is itself a species of
rationalism: see for instance, Nozick (1974), Friedman (1989), or Murphy (2010)
for examples of just that sort of rationalistic embrace of a purely civil association.

Corey goes on to conflate yet a third dichotomy as being just different names for what is essentially the same thing:
"To sum up, Oakeshott's three related formulations of a particular kind of politics (Rationalism, 'faith,' and
collectivism)" (173).

But, as discussed in Callahan (2012), Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard were both rationalists and 
representatives of the "politics of faith," but fiercely anti-collectivist. The Romans had great faith in their
tradion-oriented political system, while the American founders rationalistically designed a constitution based on their
skeptical view of what politics could achieve. Oakeshott was exploring different ways of cutting the world of politics
in two, not performing the same cut, again and again, and just calling the different slices by new names.


John Horton:

"The book articulates a distinction between two 'styles' of the activity of governingâ€”'the politics of faith' and 'the
politics of scepticism'. This distinction is clearly related to others he deploys elsewhere, most obviously between
rationalism and conservatism, collectivism and individualism and enterprise and civil association. On the one hand, the
left as we might say, we have the politics of faith, rationalism, collectivism and enterprise association and on the
other, the right, the politics of scepticism, conservatism, individualism and civil association. The terms in each of
these sets are certainly not equivalent, but they form two broad families, each loosely linked within a binary structure
that is characteristic of Oakeshott's thought." (2005: 25)

Well, at least Horton recognizes that "these sets are certainly not equivalent," but nevertheless he errs in claiming
that "they form two broad families."

[REWRITE:]
So Horton sees "enterprise association" as a synonym for "rationalism," and "civil association" as
a synonym for customary behavior. But that also won't do: Oakeshott does not fancy enterprise association becoming the
primary way of organizing a government. But most certainly, he recognizes that entities like for-profit companies,
sports teams, and charities are inherently enterprise associations. Does this mean he thinks that their managers should
operate them in a rationalistic fashion? Of course not: Rationalism will fail as a way of managing a sports team just as
surely as it will fail as a way of governing a polity.



## Going Fishing

Oakeshott himself explained for us what he is doing with these dichotomies.
As he puts it *On Human Conduct*:

"And consequently [the theorist's] engagement to be perpetually *en voyage* may
be arrested without being denied. The theorist who drops anchor here or there
and puts out his equipment of theoretic hooks and nets in order to take the
fish of the locality, interrupts but does not betray his calling... the theorist
who interrogates instead of using his theoretic equipment catches no fish."
(OHC, pg. 11)

How then, can we explain the very intelligent commentators who have mistaken various dichotomies as being simply
synonymous? I suggest that this is because, well, not synonymous, members of these various pairs often do share large
amounts of territory, in terms of what they are designating. To make this clearer, here I will drop anchor and pickup
some theoretic hooks and nets borrowed from Saussure by the way of Eco (44-45). 

[Diagram of how these pairs of terms "divide the continuum".]

The mistake is natural. It is as though Someone from a culture that only kept and only knew of 
dogs as household pets comes across a description of "household pets" and thinks,
"Oh, the person is talking about dogs." Natural, but still a mistake, since
both wild dogs and house cats exist.


## Clearing Up Confusion on Oakeshott "Opposing Abstraction"

Once we comprehend Oakeshott's fishing metaphor, we cannot only clear up the confusion about his dichotomies, but also
the perplexity about how someone who "opposes theoretical abstractions" can generate so many of them.


Spitz: "An ideal-type does not describe reality; it is an abstraction, an abridgment, or
as the earlier Oakeshott would say, an ideological way of looking at reality." (347)

Alexander:

"There is something paradoxical about being opposed to theoretical abstraction and yet having such a relentless
inclination to carry it out" (2).

No: an ideology is an abstraction that has forgotten it is an abstraction and instead takes itself to be concrete
reality, so that one attempts to find theoretical solutions to problems requiring phronesis or techne.

The rationalist is not someone who creates abstractions; he is someone who creates abstractions, and then tries to use them
as a substitute for the knowledge of a concrete activity. A map of Budapest is an abstraction. Oakeshott is not against
the making of such a map. He is against someone who believes that because they have a good map of Budapest, they
are in a position to remake the city along more rational lines.

(And the idealist claim that such-and-such is an abstraction, and therefore defective, is not a case for banning
abstractions! A map of Budapest is "defective" compared to a lifelong, intimate knowledge of its streets and byways...
but still extremely useful for a tourist trying to get around. [Bosanquet on morality.])

[Sketch of "irrational" street.]

Real example: Corbusier, who was actually designing microprocessors, not cities.

And we know this is Oakeshott's position because he told us so quite explicitly; in *On Human Conduct*, after telling us
he has been closely following Plato so far, he goes on to describe the point at which Plato goes astray:

"The cave-dwellers, upon first encountering the theorist after his return to the world of the shadows [very well might be
impressed] when he tells them that what they had always thought of as 'a horse' is not what they suppose it to be... but
is, on the contrary, a modification of the attributes of God [, and they will] applaud his performance even where they
cannot quite follow it. [The cave-dwellers can appreciate the exotic pronouncements of the theorist, as long as he
confines those pronouncements to theoretical enterprises.] but if he were to tell them that, in virtue of
his more profound understanding of the nature of horses, he is a more expert horse-man, horse-chandler, or stable boy
than they (in their ignorance) could ever hope to be, and when it becomes clear that his new learning has lost him the
ability to tell one end of a horse from the other... [then] before long the more perceptive of the cave-dwellers [will]
begin to suspect that, after all, he [is] not an interesting theorist but a fuddled and pretentious 'theoretician' who
should be sent on his travels again, or accommodated in a quiet home." (1975: 30)

So Oakeshott does not oppose theoretical abstraction at all: he opposes the *misuse* of theoretical abstraction.

Spitz:

"Apparently it is now possible to speak of the character of a modern European state without attending to the
concrete manners of behavior in England, or France, or Germany, or any other national system. The differences he so
assiduously urged us to note among them -- if we were to acquire true political knowledge -- are now forgotten;
instead, the diverse manners of behavior are blurred in a presumably (but not demonstrated)
common manner of behavior" (346)

Again, having understood the idea of "dropping anchor," we can see that
Spitz's complaint that the important differences between different European nations "are now forgotten"
is misguided: Oakeshott has not *forgotten* the differences between various countries; no, he has *dropped anchor*
at a new location, and is using different *hooks and nets* to catch what may be caught at that location. We can theorize
at the level of individual European nations, or at a higher level of abstraction, "the European nation"... but indeed
the nations themselves are abstractions, hiding the differences between the English north and south, or Paris and the
French Riviera, or Sicily and Piedmont...


## Conclusion

Of course, we cannot always accept someone's self interpretation at face value: he may misunderstand what he is
doing, may be deceiving us when he tells us what he is up to, indeed, may be deceiving himself on that topic.
But as a first hypothesis, we may start by taking his understanding as accurate, until we find reasons to believe it
is not. 

If, upon further examination, we find that his self understanding of his methods clears up matters that might otherwise
be obscure or perplexing in his work, then the case for taking him at his word is further strengthened.

I suggest that the above considerations demonstrate that Oakeshott's own explanations of his methods and his actual
employment of them are consistent: he knew what he was up to, and we need not be perplexed about any self-contradictions
in this regard.
