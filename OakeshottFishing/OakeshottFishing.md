# Michael Oakeshott Goes Fishing


"Oakeshott... liked binaries, needed them, in fact."
-- James Alexander, "An Interview with Robert Grant"


## Introduction

Michael Oakeshott did indeed like binaries. Perhaps we can even go so far as to
say he needed them. And he presented us with a number of them: rationalism
versus practical understanding, the politics of faith versus the politics of
skepticism, enterprise association versus civil association, the morality of
individualism versus the morality of collectivism, experience without
reservation or arrest versus modal experience... one could surely find
more, but that would belabor the point.

What are we to make of this plethora of binaries? This paper suggests that we
can best understand them with a metaphor Oakeshott employs in *On Human
Conduct*, that of the theorist "dropping anchor" and catching the fish
available at a certain locale reached in the enterprise of theorizing.

Once we comprehend this metaphor, we can see Oakeshott positing these various
dichotomies neither as evidence of his deciding an earlier dichotomy was wrong
or useless, but failing to describe his mistake, nor of him merely saying the
same thing using different terminology. Rather, what Oakeshott is doing in each
instance is "dropping anchor" at a different place out on the theoretic sea,
and seeing what fish he might catch from that spot.


## The Dichotomies

Let's attempt to set down the dichotomies Oakeshott, at one time or another, employs, knowing most likely we will miss
some:

- Exerience without reservation or arrest versus modal experience
- Aesthetic morality versus rule-bound morality
- The politics of faith versus the politics of skepticism
- Rationalism versus customary behavior
- The individual versus the individual manque
- Civil association versus enterprise association




## The Reactions


Spitz:

"That On Human Conduct is but a restatement of his teaching, that it is no more than a linguistic variation on familiar themes..." (342)


"Apparently it is now possible to speak of the character of a modern European state without attending to the
concrete manners of behavior in England, or France, or Germany, or any other national system. The differences he so
assiduously urged us to note among them-if we were to acquire true political knowledge-are now forgotten; instead, the
diverse manners of behavior are blurred in a presumably (but not demonstrated) common manner of behavio" (346)


"An ideal-type does not describe reality; it is an abstraction, an abridgment, or
as the earlier Oakeshott would say, an ideological way of looking at reality." (347)

No: an ideology is an abstraction that has forgotten it is an abstraction and instead takes itself to be concrete
reality, so that one attempts to find theoretical solutions to problems requiring phronesis or techne.


Elizabeth Corey

"This is what Oakeshott describes as the 'politics of skepticism' and 'civil association'" (156).

This remark clearly posits the 'politics of skepticism' and 'civil association' as two names for the same thing. But if
that is so, then the 'politics of faith' and 'enterprise association' must also be identical. But they clearly aren't:
not everyone opening a corner deli "posits a uniform condition of mundane perfection" (Corey, 172).

Some people (WHO?) have been tempted to say "enterprise association" as a synonym for "rationalism," and "civil association" as
a synonym for customary behavior. But this simply won't do: Oakeshott does not fancy enterprise Association as a way of
organizing a government. But most certainly, he recognizes that entities like for-profit companies, sports teams, and
charities are inherently enterprise associations. Does this mean he thinks that their managers should operate them in a
rationalistic fashion? Of course not: Rationalism will fail as a way of managing a sports team just as surely as it
will fail as a way of governing a polity.


## Going Fishing


As he puts it there:

"And consequently [the theoristâ€™s] engagement to be perpetually *en voyage* may
be arrested without being denied. The theorist who drops anchor here or there
and puts out his equipment of theoretic hooks and nets in order to take the
fish of the locality, interrupts but does not betray his calling... the theorist
who interrogates instead of using his theoretic equipment catches no fish."
(OHC, pg. 11)

How then, can we explain the very intelligent commentators who have mistaken various dichotomies as being simply
synonymous? I suggest that this is because, well, not synonymous, members of these various pairs often do share large
amounts of territory, in terms of what they are designating. To make this clearer, here I will drop anchor and pickup
some theoretic hooks and nets borrowed from Saussure by the way of Eco (44-45). 

The mistake is natural. It is as though Someone from a culture that only kept dogs as household pets comes across a
description of "household pets" and thinks, "Oh, the person is talking about dogs." Natural, but still a mistake, since
both wild dogs and house cats exist.
