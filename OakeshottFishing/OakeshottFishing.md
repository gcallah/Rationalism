# Michael Oakeshott Goes Fishing


"Oakeshott... liked binaries, needed them, in fact."
-- James Alexander, "An Interview with Robert Grant"


## Abstract

Michael Oakeshott did indeed like binaries. Perhaps we can even go so far as to
say he needed them. And he presented us with a number of them: rationalism
versus practical understanding, the politics of faith versus the politics of
skepticism, enterprise association versus civil association, the morality of
individualism versus the morality of collectivism, experience without
reservation or arrest versus modal experience... one could surely find
more, but that would belabor the point.

What are we to make of this plethora of binaries? This paper suggests that we
can best understand them with a metaphor Oakeshott employs in *On Human
Conduct*, that of the theorist "dropping anchor" and catching the fish
available at a certain locale reached in the enterprise of theorizing.
As he puts it there:

"And consequently [the theoristâ€™s] engagement to be perpetually *en voyage* may
be arrested without being denied. The theorist who drops anchor here or there
and puts out his equipment of theoretic hooks and nets in order to take the
fish of the locality, interrupts but does not betray his calling... the theorist
who interrogates instead of using his theoretic equipment catches no fish."
(OHC, pg. 11)

Once we comprehend this metaphor, we can see Oakeshott positing these various
dichotomies neither as evidence of his deciding an earlier dichotomy was wrong
or useless, but failing to describe his mistake, nor of him merely saying the
same thing using different terminology. Rather, what Oakeshott is doing in each
instance is "dropping anchor" at a different place out on the theoretic sea,
and seeing what fish he might catch from that spot.
