# Tocqueville and the Ongoing Crisis of the American Polity

## When Did Things Go Wrong?

- The Abandonment of the Articles
- Marbury versus Madison
- The Civil War
- The Progressive Era
- The New Deal
- The Great Society
- Roe v. Wade


To the extent that Tocqueville detected problems, and foresaw them as
leading up to aspects of our current situation, we should be reluctant to
assign because of those features to more recent phenomena, such as federal
consolidation, progressive activism, or "the 1960s."



## Political Correctness



## Materialism

"Carefully to satisfy even the least wants of the body, and to provide the
little conveniences of life, is uppermost in every mind" (signet 209)

"The desire of acquiring the comforts of the world haunts the imagination of
the poor, and the dread of losing them that of the rich" (signet 210)

"The passion for physical comforts is essentially a passion of the middle
classes..." (s 210)

"The love of well-being is now become the predominant taste of the nation..."
(s 211)

Why?






## Despotism

"After having thus taken each individual one by one into its powerful hands, and
having molded him as it pleases, the sovereign power extends its arms over the
entire society; it covers the surface of society with a network of small,
complicated, minute, and uniform rules, which the most original minds and the
most vigorous souls cannot break through to go beyond the crowd; it does not
break wills, but it softens them, bends them and directs them; it rarely forces
action, but it constantly opposes your acting; it does not destroy, it prevents
birth; it does not tyrannize, it hinders, it represses, it enervates, it
extinguishes, it stupifies, and finally it reduces each nation to being nothing
more than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is
the shepherd.

"I have always believed that this sort of servitude, regulated, mild and
peaceful, of which I have just done the portrait, could be combined better than
we imagine with some of the external forms of liberty, and that it would not be
impossible for it to be established in the very shadow of the sovereignty of
the people."  (1252)

## Conclusion

Imagine a coach full of passengers veering off the road and beginning to
descend a long hill. If the top of the hill is covered in soft grass and the
slope is mild, at first the passengers may not notice that anything has gone
wrong. It is only when, some ways down the hill, the coach hits a boulder, that
they first detect trouble. Later, doing a post mortem on their crash, some of
the passengers will identify striking that boulder as the moment when things
first began to go wrong. Some yards later, the coach hits an even larger stone.
Others of the passengers will identify that moment as the time their troubles
began. When a third, even larger rocky out cropping is struck, there will be
another faction who pointed that as the moment things went astray.

But, of course, their troubles actually began at the moment the coach left the
road. And if Tocqueville, in the 1830s, could look down the hill and foresee
the obstacles that lay ahead, then we know the coach had already left the road
by then.
