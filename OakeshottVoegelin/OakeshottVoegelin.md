# To Be Perpetually en Voyage:
## Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin on the Nature of Philosophy

## Introduction

On my desk at present is a book entitled *Idealism: The History of a Philosophy*. But is there actually
such a thing as "*a* philosophy"? Is philosophy the name of a family of things, like "mammals", so that just as there
are cats and dogs and whales and rodents, there are also idealist philosophies and materialist philosophies and
existentialist philosophies? It seems quite doubtful that the founders of philosophy would have thought so. For
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, philosophy was characterized by *zetesis*, by a *search* for wisdom, and
not by the supposed possession of wisdom captured in a "system," such as "phenomenology" or "transcendental idealism" or
"materialist reductionism."

This paper focuses on two twentieth-century thinkers who understood philosophy much as did its Greek founders:
Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more so as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher, Voegelin quite explicitly, and Oakeshott
implicitly, if we draw out the implications of his relevant writings. And I will argue that, despite the somewhat
different sources of their understanding of what philosophy is, they largely agree on the answer to that question.


## Oakeshott and Voegelin as Contemporaries

Oakeshott and Voegelin were as much contemporaries as any two significant thinkers in the same field
are likely to be: they were both born in 1901, both completed their university studies during the 1920s, published their
first books in the 1930s, gained public prominence with works published soon after World War II, and continued breaking
new ground with works they continued writing until they passed away, Voegelin in 1985, and Oakeshott in 1990.

Each is also often considered a "conservative," a label Voegelin explicitly rejected, and which Oakeshott wore lightly.
Both of them were also on friendly terms with F.A. Hayek, and were feted by the American journal *National Review*.

Despite these commonalities, neither of the pair addressed the other's work in any depth. Oakeshott (anonymously)
wrote a generally favorable review of Voegelin's *New Science of Politics*, in which the reader "will find himself being
lead on a remarkably interesting journey by a guide of rare knowledge and intelligence" (2004: 229). Voegelin favorably
cites Oakeshott's introduction to *Leviathan* (2000: 36),

## Philosophy Is Not a Doctrine or a System


Oakeshott:
"But a reflective enterprise which had the precise purpose of avoiding all such fixed points of reference, one designed
to remain fluid, one for which no presupposition was sacred, would not improperly be called *radically subversive*.
This, I believe, is this distinguishing characteristic of philosophical reflection." (1993: 141)


## Instead, Philosophy Is an Attitude Towards Being



## Oakeshott's Sources


Bosanquet: "This characteristic of philosophy, that it speaks about the whole complex of being without any
reservation..." (2012: 25).

## Voegelin's Sources



## Political Philosophy Versus Ideology

Besides agreeing on the basic nature of philosophy, Voegelin anbd Oakeshott also share the view that political philosophy is
clearly distinguishable from political ideology.



"Plato was a philosopher, not a political ideologist" (2001: 189).
