# To Be Perpetually En Voyage:
## Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin on the Nature of Philosophy

## Introduction

As I'm writing this line, I am reading a book entitled *Idealism: The History of a Philosophy*. But is there actually
such a thing as "*a* philosophy"? Is philosophy, the name of a family of things, like "mammals", so that just as there
are cats and dogs and whales and rodents, there are also idealist philosophies and materialist philosophies and
existentialist philosophies? It seems quite doubtful that the founders of philosophy would have thought so. For
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, philosophy was characterized by *zetesis*, by a *search* for wisdom, and
not by the possssion of wisdom captured in a "system," such as "phenomenology" or "transcendental idealism" or "materialist
reductionism."

This paper focuses on two twentieth-century philosophers who very much agreed with the Greek thinkers who pioneered
philosophy: Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher, Voegelin quite explicitly, and Oakeshott
if we draw out the implications of his relevant writings.

The two were as much contemporaries as any two significant thinkers in the same field
are likely to be: they were both born in 1901, both completed their university studies during the 1920s, published their
first books in the 1930s, gained public prominence with works published soon after World War II, and continued breaking
new ground with works they continued writing until they passed away, Voegelin in 1985, and Oakeshott in 1990.

Each is also often considered a "conservative," a label Voegelin explicitly rejected, and which Oakeshott wore lightly.
Both of them were also on friendly terms with F.A. Hayek, were feted by the American journal *National Review*, and...

Despite these commonalities, neither of the pair addressed the other's work in any depth. Oakeshott wrote a generally
favorable review of Voegelin's *New Science of Politics*, and Voegelin... .
