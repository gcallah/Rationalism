# To Be Perpetually en Voyage:
## Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin on the Nature of Philosophy

## Introduction

On my desk at present is a book entitled *Idealism: The History of a Philosophy*. But is there actually
such a thing as "*a* philosophy"? Is philosophy the name of a family of things, like "mammals", so that just as there
are cats and dogs and whales and rodents, there are also idealist philosophies and materialist philosophies and
existentialist philosophies? It seems quite doubtful that the founders of philosophy would have thought so. For
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, philosophy was characterized by *zetesis*, by a *search* for wisdom, and
not by the supposed possession of wisdom captured in a "system," such as "phenomenology" or "transcendental idealism" or
"materialist reductionism."

This paper focuses on two twentieth-century thinkers who understood philosophy much as did its Greek founders:
Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more so as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher, Voegelin quite explicitly, and Oakeshott
implicitly, if we draw out the implications of his relevant writings. And I will argue that, despite the somewhat
different sources of their understanding of what philosophy is, they largely agree on the answer to that question.

Neverthless, that basic agreement is followed by a great divergence: for EV, philosophy has vital practical value:
following Plato, it is a discipline for creating right order in the soul, which is the foundation of political order. To
the contrary, MO sees philosophy as essentially worthless for guiding practical affairs. This paper will also ask from
whence arises this parting of the ways.


## Oakeshott and Voegelin as Contemporaries

Oakeshott and Voegelin were as much contemporaries as any two significant thinkers in the same field
are likely to be: they were both born in 1901, both completed their university studies during the 1920s, published their
first books in the 1930s, gained public prominence with works published soon after World War II, and continued breaking
new ground with works they continued writing until they passed away, Voegelin in 1985, and Oakeshott in 1990.

Each is also often considered a "conservative," a label Voegelin explicitly rejected, and which Oakeshott wore lightly.
Both of them were also on friendly terms with F.A. Hayek, and were feted by the American journal *National Review*.

Despite these commonalities, neither of the pair addressed the other's work in any depth. Oakeshott (anonymously)
wrote a generally favorable review of Voegelin's *New Science of Politics*, in which the reader "will find himself being
lead on a remarkably interesting journey by a guide of rare knowledge and intelligence" (2004: 229). Voegelin favorably
cites Oakeshott's introduction to *Leviathan* (2000a: 36),

## Philosophy Springs from Wonder and Ignorance


MO: "All of reflection begins with something assumed to be known, but in reflection what is assumed to be known is assumed
also not to be known. We begin with knowledge, which is nevertheless assumed to be ignorance."


MO: "If, then, human beings were absolutely ignorant, it is impossible to see how they could ever reflect or ever
acquire knowledge. If it were possible to enjoy an experience of mere 'observation', it is impossible to see how
knowledge could ever spring from it" (1993: 139).

Voegelin also sees the quest for understanding as grounded in knowledge which is nevertheless ignorance:

"without questioning in confusion, [there would be] no consciousness of ignorance. There would be no existential unrest
moving toward the quest of the ground unless the unrest was already man's knowledge of existence from a ground that
he is not himself." (1990a: 273)



Voegelin: "the consciousness of questioning unrest in a state of ignorance" (1990a: 272).


## Philosophizing Is Not About Creating a Doctrine or a System


MO rejects the idea that the essence of philosophy is to create a "philosophical system":

"The aim in philosophical reflection is to think philosophically, not to construct a 'philosophy'" (1993: 130).

Compare that with Voegelin, from the essay "Remembrance of Things Past":

"A consciousness of this kind is not an a priori structure, nor does it just happen, nor is its horizon given. It rather
is a ceaseless action of expanding, ordering, articulating, and correcting itself... It is a permanent effort at
responsive openness to the appeal of reality, bewaring of premature satisfaction, and above all, at avoiding the
self-destructive phantasy of believing the reality of which it is a part to be an object external to itself that can be
mastered by bringing it into the form of a system." (1990a: 305)

In a section of *The Ecumenic Age* titled "The deformation of philosophy into doctrine," Voegelin writes that, with the
Stoics:

"A new intellectual game with imaginary realities in an imaginary realm of thought, the game of propositional
metaphysics, has been opened with world-historic consequences that reach into our own present..." (2000c: 91)

And in "Reason: The Classic Experience," Voegelin writes:

"Thus philosophy in the classic sense is not a body of 'ideas' or 'opinions' about the divine ground, dispensed by a
person who calls himself off 'philosopher,' but a man's responsive pursuit of his questioning unrest to the divine
source that is aroused it." (1990a: 272)


## Philosophy Is Radical

Because philosophy is a "ceaseless action" of questioning, it is necessary radical compared to all modes of inquiry that
reach fixed conclusions. As Oakeshott puts it:

"But a reflective enterprise which had the precise purpose of avoiding all such fixed points of reference, one designed
to remain fluid, one for which no presupposition was sacred, would not improperly be called *radically subversive*.
This, I believe, is this distinguishing characteristic of philosophical reflection." (1993: 141)

Voegelin says something very similar in this passage:

"and if I certainly did not care to become a neo-Kantian subject of cognition, not even an intersubjective one, neither
did I particularly care to become a Neoplatonist, or a neo-Thomist metaphysician, or an existentialist, Christian or
otherwise... I knew that the revolt had to be considerably more radical to match the problems raised by the disorder of
the age." (1990a: 306)






## Political Philosophy Versus Ideology

Besides agreeing on the basic nature of philosophy, Voegelin anbd Oakeshott also share the view that political philosophy is
clearly distinguishable from political ideology.



"Plato was a philosopher, not a political ideologist" (2001: 189).



## Plato: The Common Source


The most important difference between MO and EV concerns the practical value of philosophy: for MO it has (almost?) no
practical value, while for EV its practical value is significant: in fact, the philosopher, through the order in his own
soul, offers the polity its only opportunity to achieve order in itself. Given how close are their understandings of
what philosophy is, we have a real puzzle here: how did their estimates of its practical value diverge so sharply?

Voegelin follows Plato closely in his understanding of philosophy as a way to achieve right order in the soul.

For example, EV says of Socrates: "He is the gift of god to Athens, given as a gadfly to the polis to stir it
back into life" (2000b: 62).


"the first step on the way up must be a search for a helper." (2000b: 112)

"we shall fare well" (2000b: 113)

"the philosopher, who must return from the vision of the Agathon to help his fellow prisoners" (2000b: 114)


MO was also a close student of Plato's work. As Timothy Fuller says of his post-WWII essays, "These writings show a
strong affinity for the Socratic style of philosophizing" (1993: 23).

After a number of pages discussing the nature of theorizing, Oakeshott acknowledges his debt to Plato: "This account of
the engagement of understanding owes so much to the account in Plato" -- then comes the crucial passage for
understanding his difference from Voegelin -- "that it may be instructive to notice its divergencies" (27).

When Plato's philosopher returns to the cave, his "understanding, it goes without saying, is vastly superior to that of
the cave-dwellers. But it is represented as something more than merely superior. It is alleged to be a complete
*substitute* for that and for every other conditional understanding" (29).

The philosopher's belief that he can substitute his philosophical understanding for knowledge of conditional platforms
of understanding leads the cave dwellers to send him packing:

"The cave-dwellers, upon first encountering the theorist after his return to the world of the shadows [very well might be
impressed] when he tells them that what they had always thought of as 'a horse' is not what they suppose it to be... but
is, on the contrary, a modification of the attributes of God [, and they will] applaud his performance even where they
cannot quite follow it. [The cave-dwellers can appreciate the exotic pronouncements of the theorist, as long as he
confines those pronouncements to their genuine field of applicability.] but if he were to tell them that, in virtue of
his more profound understanding of the nature of horses, he is a more expert horse-man, horse-chandler, or stable boy
than they (in their ignorance) could ever hope to be, and when it becomes clear that his new learning has lost him the
ability to tell one end of a horse from the other... [then] before long the more perceptive of the cave-dwellers [will]
begin to suspect that, after all, he [is] not an interesting theorist but a fuddled and pretentious 'theoretician' who
should be sent on his travels again, or accommodated in a quiet home." (1975: 30)

## Hobbes: The Fork in the Road

I suggest we can point to where the fork in the paths followed by MO and EV is located; and that location is Thomas
Hobbes.

For EV, Hobbes is a representative of modern alienation. For example, he writes "In the modern Western history of
unrest... A Hobbes replaces the *summum Bonum* by the *summum malum* as the ordering force of man's existence" (1990a: 277).
In the essay "The Eclipse of Reality," he describes how, for many English thinkers,
Hobbes and Locke are two "blocks" preventing the recognition of "a larger horizon of a truth of existence" (1990b: 154).

EV discusses Hobbes extensively in *The New Science of Politics*, and it is worth quoting him at some length here:

"""
The function of Gnosticism as the civil theology of Western society, its destruction of the truth of the soul, and its
disregard for the problem of existence have been set forth in sufficient detail to make the fatal importance of the
problem clear. The inquiry can now return to the great thinker who discovered its nature and tried to solve it by his
theory of representation. In the seventeenth century the existence of the English national society seemed in danger of
being destroyed by Gnostic revolutionaries, as today on a larger scale the same danger seems to threaten the existence
of Western society as a whole. Hobbes tried to meet the danger by devising a civil theology which made the order of a
society in existence the truth which it represented -- and by the side of this truth no other should be held. This was an
eminently sensible idea in so far as it put the whole weight on existence that had been so badly neglected by the
Gnostics. The practical value of the idea, however, rested on the assumption that the transcendent truth which men tried
to represent in their societies, after mankind had gone through the experiences of philosophy and Christianity, could be
neglected in its turn. Against the Gnostics who did not want society to exist unless its order represented a specific
type of truth, Hobbes insisted that any order would do if it secured the existence of society. In order to make this
conception valid, he had to create his new idea of man. Human nature would have to find fulfilment in existence itself;
a purpose of man beyond existence would have to be denied.  Hobbes countered the Gnostic immanentization of the eschaton
which endangered existence by a radical immanence of existence which denied the eschaton.

The result of this eífort was ambivalent. In order to maintain his position against the fighting churches and sects,
Hobbes had to deny that their zeal was inspired, however misguided, by a search for truth. Their struggle had to be
interpreted, in terms of immanent existence, as an unfettered expression of their lust for power; and their professed
religious concem had to be revealed as a mask for their existential lust. 

In carrying out this analysis, Hobbes proved to be one of the greatest psychologists of all times; his achievements in
unmasking the libido dominandi behind the pretense of religious zeal and reforming idealism are as solid today as they
were at the time when he wrote. This magnifkent psychological achievement, however, was purchased at a heavy price.
Hobbes rightly diagnosed the corruptivc ckment of passion in thc re- ligiousncss of thc Puritan Gnostics. He did not,
however, in- terpret passion as the source of corruption in the life of the spirit, but rather the life of the spirit as
the extreme of exis- tential passion. Hence, he could not interpret the nature of man from the vantage point of the
maximum of differentiation through the experiences of transcendence so that passion, and especially the fundamental
passion, *superbia*, could be discerned as the permanently present danger of the fall from true nature; but he had, on
the contrary, to interpret the life of passion as the nature of man so that the phenomena of spiritual life appeared as
extremes of superbia. 

According to this conception, the generic nature of man must be studied in terms of human passions; the objects of the
passions are no legitimate object of inquiry. 8 This is the funda¬ mental counterposition to classic and Christian moral
philos- ophy. Aristotelian ethics starts from the purposes of action and explores the order of human life in terms of
the ordination of all actions toward a highest purpose, the *summum bonum*; Hobbes, on the contrary, insists that there is
no *summum bonum*, 'as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philosophers.' With the *summum bonum*, however,
disappears the source of order from human life; and not only from the life of individual man but also from life in
society; for, as you will remember, the order of the life in community depends on *homonoia*, in the Aristotelian and
Christian sense, that is, on the participation in the common *nous*.

(2000d, 233-234)
"""

Let us now look at the role of Hobbes in MO's thought, as described by Timothy Fuller:

"In my view, MO is following the inspiration of Hobbes in insisting upon the separation of Christianity from all
dependence on Aristotelian/scholastic teleology. I think he believed the Christianity, thus purged was far closer to
expressing the truth of the human condition than anything derived from teleological theological philosophy/theology."
(1993: 19)


Notice how close this is to EV's understanding of Hobbes's role in some English thinkers' attitude towards the
classical/Christian tradition, the difference being, of course, that in EV's case Hobbes is a "block" to fully
understanding that tradition, while for MO (as Fuller interprets him) Hobbes is the "inspiration" for (meritoriously)
setting aside that tradition.

It is interesting to note here that, while EV shares MO's rejection of the "dogmatic metaphysics" of the scholastics,
this does not lead the former as it does the latter to reject teleology, or, indeed, that tradition as a whole. For
instance, EV cites Aquinas as asserting that Christ is "the head of all men," and not just those who have been born
after the birth of Jesus, in order to refute the dogmatic belief that "all mankind that happened to live before Christ"
have been condemned to Hell. (1990a: 78). As he puts it, "it is Thomas Aquinas who considers the Christ to be head of the
*corpus mysticum* that embraces, not only Christians, but all mankind from the creation of the world to its end" (12:
294) And he argues that Anselm's ontological argument is misunderstood if taken as a philosophical "proof" of God's
existence, but that it is, rather, better understood as a meditation or prayer. (1990b: 191-206)

Also of interest is the fact that one of the twentieth century's leading Thomists, Jacques Maritain, held that Thomism
itself is not best understood as dogmatic metaphysics: "Authentic Thomism is not a closed system; it is a wisdom that is
essentially open and without frontiers by the very fact that it is a doctrine in movement and vital development."
