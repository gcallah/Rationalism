# To Be Perpetually en Voyage:
## Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin on the Nature of Philosophy

## Introduction

On my desk at present is a book entitled *Idealism: The History of a Philosophy*. But is there actually
such a thing as "*a* philosophy"? Is philosophy the name of a family of things, like "mammals", so that just as there
are cats and dogs and whales and rodents, there are also idealist philosophies and materialist philosophies and
existentialist philosophies? It seems quite doubtful that the founders of philosophy would have thought so. For
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, philosophy was characterized by *zetesis*, by a *search* for wisdom, and
not by the supposed possession of wisdom captured in a "system," such as "phenomenology" or "transcendental idealism" or
"materialist reductionism."

This paper focuses on two twentieth-century thinkers who understood philosophy much as did its Greek founders:
Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more so as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher, Voegelin quite explicitly, and Oakeshott
implicitly, if we draw out the implications of his relevant writings. And I will argue that, despite the somewhat
different sources of their understanding of what philosophy is, they largely agree on the answer to that question.


## Oakeshott and Voegelin as Contemporaries

Oakeshott and Voegelin were as much contemporaries as any two significant thinkers in the same field
are likely to be: they were both born in 1901, both completed their university studies during the 1920s, published their
first books in the 1930s, gained public prominence with works published soon after World War II, and continued breaking
new ground with works they continued writing until they passed away, Voegelin in 1985, and Oakeshott in 1990.

Each is also often considered a "conservative," a label Voegelin explicitly rejected, and which Oakeshott wore lightly.
Both of them were also on friendly terms with F.A. Hayek, and were feted by the American journal *National Review*.

Despite these commonalities, neither of the pair addressed the other's work in any depth. Oakeshott (anonymously)
wrote a generally favorable review of Voegelin's *New Science of Politics*, in which the reader "will find himself being
lead on a remarkably interesting journey by a guide of rare knowledge and intelligence" (2004: 229). Voegelin favorably
cites Oakeshott's introduction to *Leviathan* (2000: 36),

## Philosophy Springs from Wonder and Ignorance


MO: "All of reflection begins with something assumed to be known, but in reflection what is assumed to be known is assumed
also not to be known. We begin with knowledge, which is nevertheless assumed to be ignorance."


MO: "If, then, human beings were absolutely ignorant, it is impossible to see how they could ever reflect or ever
acquire knowledge. If it were possible to enjoy an experience of mere 'observation', it is impossible to see how
knowledge could ever spring from it" (1993: 139).

Voegelin also sees the quest for understanding as grounded in knowledge which is nevertheless ignorance:

"without questioning in confusion, [there would be] no consciousness of ignorance. There would be no existential unrest
moving toward the quest of the ground unless the unrest was already man's knowledge of existence from a ground that
he is not himself." (1990: 273)



Voegelin: "the consciousness of questioning unrest in a state of ignorance" (1990: 272).


## Philosophizing Is Not About Creating a Doctrine or a System


MO rejects the idea that the essence of philosophy is to create a "philosophical system":

"The aim in philosophical reflection is to think philosophically, not to construct a 'philosophy'" (1993: 130).

Compare that with Voegelin, from the essay "Remembrance of Things Past":

"A consciousness of this kind is not an a priori structure, nor does it just happen, nor is its horizon given. It rather
is a ceaseless action of expanding, ordering, articulating, and correcting itself... It is a permanent effort at
responsive openness to the appeal of reality, bewaring of premature satisfaction, and above all, at avoiding the
self-destructive phantasy of believing the reality of which it is a part to be an object external to itself that can be
mastered by bringing it into the form of a system." (1990: 305)

And in "Reason: The Classic Experience," Voegelin writes:

"Thus philosophy in the classic sense is not a body of 'ideas' or 'opinions' about the divine ground, dispensed by a
person who calls himself off 'philosopher,' but a man's responsive pursuit of his questioning unrest to the divine
source that is aroused it." (1990: 272)


## Philosophy Is Radical

Because philosophy is a "ceaseless action" of questioning, it is necessary radical compared to all modes of inquiry that
reach fixed conclusions. As Oakeshott puts it:

"But a reflective enterprise which had the precise purpose of avoiding all such fixed points of reference, one designed
to remain fluid, one for which no presupposition was sacred, would not improperly be called *radically subversive*.
This, I believe, is this distinguishing characteristic of philosophical reflection." (1993: 141)

Voegelin says something very similar in this passage:

"and if I certainly did not care to become a neo-Kantian subject of cognition, not even an intersubjective one, neither
did I particularly care to become a Neoplatonist, or a neo-Thomist metaphysician, or an existentialist, Christian or
otherwise... I knew that the revolt had to be considerably more radical to match the problems raised by the disorder of
the age." (1990: 306)






## Political Philosophy Versus Ideology

Besides agreeing on the basic nature of philosophy, Voegelin anbd Oakeshott also share the view that political philosophy is
clearly distinguishable from political ideology.



"Plato was a philosopher, not a political ideologist" (2001: 189).

Bosanquet: "This characteristic of philosophy, that it speaks about the whole complex of being without any
reservation..." (2012: 25).
