# Summum Bonum


"There is, then, no *summum bonum* or *logos*, no Aristotelian mean or Platonic form of the good, no perfect form of
human life, which we may never achieve, but towards which we may struggle, no measuring rod on which different forms of
human life encompassing different and uncombinable goods can be ranked." (Gray, 1996, p. 65)
