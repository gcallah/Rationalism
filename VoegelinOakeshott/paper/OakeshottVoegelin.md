# To Be Perpetually en Voyage:
## Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin on the Nature of Philosophy

## Introduction

On my desk at present is a book entitled *Idealism: The History of a Philosophy*. But is there actually
such a thing as "*a* philosophy"? Is philosophy the name of a family of things, like "mammals", so that just as there
are cats and dogs and whales and rodents, there are also idealist philosophies and materialist philosophies and
existentialist philosophies? It seems quite doubtful that the founders of philosophy would have thought so. For
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, philosophy was characterized by *zetesis*, by a *search* for wisdom, and
not by the supposed possession of wisdom captured in a "system," such as "phenomenology" or "transcendental idealism" or
"materialist reductionism."

This paper focuses on two twentieth-century thinkers who understood philosophy much as did its Greek founders:
Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more so as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher. And I will argue that
they largely agree on the nature of philosophy.

Neverthless, that basic agreement is followed by a great divergence: for Voegelin, philosophy has vital practical value:
following Plato, it is a discipline for creating right order in the soul, which is the foundation of political order. To
the contrary, Oakeshott sees philosophy as essentially worthless for guiding practical affairs. This paper will also ask from
whence arises this parting of the ways.


## Oakeshott and Voegelin as Contemporaries

Oakeshott and Voegelin were as much contemporaries as any two significant thinkers in the same field
are likely to be: they were both born in 1901, both completed their university studies during the 1920s, each of them
published a survey book of contemporary European political camps in the late 1930s,
gained public prominence with works published soon after World War II, and continued breaking
new ground with works they continued writing until they passed away, Voegelin in 1985, and Oakeshott in 1990.

Each is also often considered a "conservative," a label Voegelin explicitly rejected, and which Oakeshott wore lightly.
Both of them were also on friendly terms with F.A. Hayek, and were feted by the American journal *National Review*.

Despite these commonalities, neither of the pair addressed the other's work in any depth. Oakeshott (anonymously)
wrote a generally favorable review of Voegelin's *New Science of Politics*, in which the reader "will find himself being
lead on a remarkably interesting journey by a guide of rare knowledge and intelligence" (2004: 229). Voegelin favorably
cites Oakeshott's introduction to *Leviathan* (2000a: 36), 

I can add two references from personal conversation. The first was when David Boucher told me that Oakeshott had
personally recommended to him that he read Voegelin. The second was when, at a conference, I was told by someone that he
had met Voegelin and, upon telling him that he was working on Oakeshott, Voegelin said, "Ah, that English mystic." (It
should be noted that from Voegelin, that is high praise.)

## Experience Without Reservation or Arrest

### Philosophy Springs from Wonder and Ignorance

In all of the following, it must be remembered that neither Oakeshott's or Voegelin's views were static, and this is not
a historical study of their thought, so of necessity there is some collapsing of decades of evolving thoughts into a few
pages. Nevertheless, I believe there is enough continuity in their understanding of philosophy that this compression
does not also entail any great distortion.

Oakeshott notes that reflection, the beginning of philosophy, springs from wondering about something already known:

"All of reflection begins with something assumed to be known, but in reflection what is assumed to be known is assumed
also not to be known. We begin with knowledge, which is nevertheless assumed to be ignorance...
If, then, human beings were absolutely ignorant, it is impossible to see how they could ever reflect or ever
acquire knowledge. If it were possible to enjoy an experience of mere 'observation', it is impossible to see how
knowledge could ever spring from it" (1993: 138-139).

Voegelin also sees the quest for understanding as grounded in knowledge which is nevertheless ignorance:

"without questioning in confusion, [there would be] no consciousness of ignorance. There would be no existential unrest
moving toward the quest of the ground unless the unrest was already man's knowledge of existence from a ground that
he is not himself." (1990a: 273)


### Philosophizing Is Not About Creating a Doctrine or a System


Oakeshott rejects the idea that the essence of philosophy is to create a "philosophical system":

"The aim in philosophical reflection is to think philosophically, not to construct a 'philosophy'" (1993: 130).

Compare that with Voegelin, from the essay "Remembrance of Things Past":

"A consciousness of this kind is not an a priori structure, nor does it just happen, nor is its horizon given. It rather
is a ceaseless action of expanding, ordering, articulating, and correcting itself... It is a permanent effort at
responsive openness to the appeal of reality, bewaring of premature satisfaction, and above all, at avoiding the
self-destructive phantasy of believing the reality of which it is a part to be an object external to itself that can be
mastered by bringing it into the form of a system." (1990a: 305)

In a section of *The Ecumenic Age* titled "The deformation of philosophy into doctrine," Voegelin writes that, with the
Stoics:

"A new intellectual game with imaginary realities in an imaginary realm of thought, the game of propositional
metaphysics, has been opened with world-historic consequences that reach into our own present..." (2000c: 91)

And in "Reason: The Classic Experience," Voegelin writes:

"Thus philosophy in the classic sense is not a body of 'ideas' or 'opinions' about the divine ground, dispensed by a
person who calls himself off 'philosopher,' but a man's responsive pursuit of his questioning unrest to the divine
source that is aroused it." (1990a: 272)


### Philosophy Is Radical

Because philosophy is a "ceaseless action" of questioning, it is necessary radical compared to all modes of inquiry that
reach fixed conclusions. As Oakeshott puts it:

"Philosophical experience is, then, experience, without reservation, or rest, without presupposition apostolate, without
limit or category..." (1933: 347).

Or, fifteen or so years later, he writes:

"But a reflective enterprise which had the precise purpose of avoiding all such fixed points of reference, one designed
to remain fluid, one for which no presupposition was sacred, would not improperly be called *radically subversive*.
This, I believe, is this distinguishing characteristic of philosophical reflection." (1993: 141)

Voegelin says something very similar in this passage:

"and if I certainly did not care to become a neo-Kantian subject of cognition, not even an intersubjective one, neither
did I particularly care to become a Neoplatonist, or a neo-Thomist metaphysician, or an existentialist, Christian or
otherwise... I knew that the revolt had to be considerably more radical to match the problems raised by the disorder of
the age." (1990a: 306)


### Political Philosophy Versus Ideology

Besides agreeing on the basic nature of philosophy, Voegelin and Oakeshott also share the view that political philosophy is
clearly distinguishable from political ideology.

For instance, Voegelin writes, "Plato was a philosopher, not a political ideologist" (2001: 189).

For Oakeshott, as Fuller puts it, "To consider politics philosophically is to describe the necessary character of politics
in its endless efforts to preserve and to change; it is not to prescribe courses of action" (2024: 152).

[More materials should be added here.]

## Plato: A Common Source

Oakeshott and Voegelin share a significant interest and debt to Plato. At the beginning of his first book, Oakeshott writes, "Anyone who has
had a glimpse of the range and subtlety of the thought of Plato... will long ago despaired of becoming a philosopher"
(1933: 7). And in a work with "experience" in its title, he looks to Plato to define experience: "Experience, says
Plato, is dialectic; the true form of experience is argument" (1933: 37).
Over a decade later, when Oakeshott declares the method he will use in an essay, he also remarks "This, of course, is the
philosophical method and aim presented to us in the Socratic dialogues; and it is one with which I see no reason to
quarrel" (1993: 130). As Timothy Fuller says of all of Oakeshott's
post-WWII essays, "These writings show a strong affinity for the Socratic style of philosophizing" (1993: 23).


Voegelin, of course, devoted a 400-page book entirely to the work of Plato and Aristotle (2000b), and the Cumulative index of
Voegelin's collected works well over 300 references to Plato scatted across at least 17 volumes.

But it also, in their remarks on Plato, the major difference in Oakeshott's and Voegelin's understanding of philosophy becomes
apparent: does it have any practical value? For Oakeshott, the answer is a clear "no."
As Fuller puts it, "But philosophy for Oakeshott is also, categorically, speaking, impractical. The search for
truth has nothing to do with daily life." (1993: 19)


Meanwhile, for Voegelin its practical value is significant: in fact, the philosopher, through the order in his own
soul, offers the polity its only opportunity to achieve order in itself.

Voegelin follows Plato closely in his understanding of philosophy as a way to achieve right order in the soul.

For example, Voegelin says of Socrates: "He is the gift of god to Athens, given as a gadfly to the polis to stir it
back into life" (2000b: 62).

For a diseased soul, "the first step on the way up must be a search for a helper" (2000b: 112), and in this case, the
helper is "the philosopher, who must return from the vision of the Agathon to help his fellow prisoners" (2000b: 114)

Oakeshott's parting of the ways with Plato on the practical value of philosophy appears early on, when he writes: "There is a
difference between the 'unexamined life', which Plato said no man would wish to lead, and a life devoid of philosophical
or speculative interest. Though it is, perhaps, the major defect of Plato's philosophy it that fails to recognize this
difference" (1933: 303). And he claims, a few dozen pages later, "a satisfactory life does not depend upon
philosophical knowledge; indeed, such knowledge is irrelevant to it" (1933: 339). And a little later he argues that
"To turn philosophy into a way of life is at once to have abandoned life and philosophy" (1933: 355).
And he even cites Socrates in support of this view: "This, perhaps, is the meaning, or one of the meetings, of the
passages in the *Phaedo* and elsewhere, in which Socrates asserts that those who engage in philosophy 'study only dying
and death.' For to be dead to the world of practice... is the beginning of philosophy" (1933: 310).

Oakeshott expands upon his brief comment on Plato's "major defect" four decades later, in *On Human Conduct*.
After a number of pages discussing the nature of theorizing, Oakeshott acknowledges his debt to Plato: "This account of
the engagement of understanding owes so much to the account in Plato" -- then comes the crucial passage for
understanding his difference from Voegelin -- "that it may be instructive to notice its divergencies" (27).

When Plato's philosopher returns to the cave, his "understanding, it goes without saying, is vastly superior to that of
the cave-dwellers. But it is represented as something more than merely superior. It is alleged to be a complete
*substitute* for that and for every other conditional understanding" (29).

The philosopher's belief that he can substitute his philosophical understanding for knowledge of conditional platforms
of understanding leads the cave dwellers to send him packing:

"The cave-dwellers, upon first encountering the theorist after his return to the world of the shadows [very well might be
impressed] when he tells them that what they had always thought of as 'a horse' is not what they suppose it to be... but
is, on the contrary, a modification of the attributes of God [, and they will] applaud his performance even where they
cannot quite follow it. [The cave-dwellers can appreciate the exotic pronouncements of the theorist, as long as he
confines those pronouncements to their genuine field of applicability.] but if he were to tell them that, in virtue of
his more profound understanding of the nature of horses, he is a more expert horse-man, horse-chandler, or stable boy
than they (in their ignorance) could ever hope to be, and when it becomes clear that his new learning has lost him the
ability to tell one end of a horse from the other... [then] before long the more perceptive of the cave-dwellers [will]
begin to suspect that, after all, he [is] not an interesting theorist but a fuddled and pretentious 'theoretician' who
should be sent on his travels again, or accommodated in a quiet home." (1975: 30)

Given how close Oakeshott's and Voegelin's understandings of what philosophy is, we have a real puzzle here: how did their evaluation
of its practical value diverge so sharply?


## Hobbes: The Fork in the Road

I suggest we can point to where the paths followed by Oakeshott and Voegelin forked; and that fork is Thomas
Hobbes.

For Voegelin, Hobbes is a representative of modern alienation. For example, he writes "In the modern Western history of
unrest... A Hobbes replaces the *summum Bonum* by the *summum malum* as the ordering force of man's existence" (1990a: 277).
In the essay "The Eclipse of Reality," he describes how, for many English thinkers,
Hobbes and Locke are two "blocks" preventing the recognition of "a larger horizon of a truth of existence" (1990b: 154).

Voegelin discusses Hobbes extensively in *The New Science of Politics*, and it is worth quoting him at some length here:

"""
The function of Gnosticism as the civil theology of Western society, its destruction of the truth of the soul, and its
disregard for the problem of existence have been set forth in sufficient detail to make the fatal importance of the
problem clear. The inquiry can now return to the great thinker who discovered its nature and tried to solve it by his
theory of representation. In the seventeenth century the existence of the English national society seemed in danger of
being destroyed by Gnostic revolutionaries, as today on a larger scale the same danger seems to threaten the existence
of Western society as a whole. Hobbes tried to meet the danger by devising a civil theology which made the order of a
society in existence the truth which it represented -- and by the side of this truth no other should be held. This was an
eminently sensible idea in so far as it put the whole weight on existence that had been so badly neglected by the
Gnostics. The practical value of the idea, however, rested on the assumption that the transcendent truth which men tried
to represent in their societies, after mankind had gone through the experiences of philosophy and Christianity, could be
neglected in its turn. Against the Gnostics who did not want society to exist unless its order represented a specific
type of truth, Hobbes insisted that any order would do if it secured the existence of society. In order to make this
conception valid, he had to create his new idea of man. Human nature would have to find fulfilment in existence itself;
a purpose of man beyond existence would have to be denied.  Hobbes countered the Gnostic immanentization of the eschaton
which endangered existence by a radical immanence of existence which denied the eschaton.

The result of this eífort was ambivalent. In order to maintain his position against the fighting churches and sects,
Hobbes had to deny that their zeal was inspired, however misguided, by a search for truth. Their struggle had to be
interpreted, in terms of immanent existence, as an unfettered expression of their lust for power; and their professed
religious concem had to be revealed as a mask for their existential lust. 

In carrying out this analysis, Hobbes proved to be one of the greatest psychologists of all times; his achievements in
unmasking the libido dominandi behind the pretense of religious zeal and reforming idealism are as solid today as they
were at the time when he wrote. This magnifkent psychological achievement, however, was purchased at a heavy price.
Hobbes rightly diagnosed the corruptivc ckment of passion in thc religiousncss of thc Puritan Gnostics. He did not,
however, interpret passion as the source of corruption in the life of the spirit, but rather the life of the spirit as
the extreme of existential passion. Hence, he could not interpret the nature of man from the vantage point of the
maximum of differentiation through the experiences of transcendence so that passion, and especially the fundamental
passion, *superbia*, could be discerned as the permanently present danger of the fall from true nature; but he had, on
the contrary, to interpret the life of passion as the nature of man so that the phenomena of spiritual life appeared as
extremes of superbia. 

According to this conception, the generic nature of man must be studied in terms of human passions; the objects of the
passions are no legitimate object of inquiry. 8 This is the funda¬ mental counterposition to classic and Christian moral
philosophy. Aristotelian ethics starts from the purposes of action and explores the order of human life in terms of
the ordination of all actions toward a highest purpose, the *summum bonum*; Hobbes, on the contrary, insists that there is
no *summum bonum*, 'as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philosophers.' With the *summum bonum*, however,
disappears the source of order from human life; and not only from the life of individual man but also from life in
society; for, as you will remember, the order of the life in community depends on *homonoia*, in the Aristotelian and
Christian sense, that is, on the participation in the common *nous*.

(2000d, 233-234)
"""

Let us now look at the role of Hobbes in Oakeshott's thought, as described by Timothy Fuller:

"In my view, Oakeshott is following the inspiration of Hobbes in insisting upon the separation of Christianity from all
dependence on Aristotelian/scholastic teleology. I think he believed the Christianity, thus purged was far closer to
expressing the truth of the human condition than anything derived from teleological theological philosophy/theology."
(1993: 19)

Notice how close this is to Voegelin's understanding of Hobbes's role in some English thinkers' attitude towards the
classical/Christian tradition, the difference being, of course, that in Voegelin's case Hobbes is a "block" to fully
understanding that tradition, while for Oakeshott (as Fuller interprets him) Hobbes is the "inspiration" for (meritoriously)
setting aside that tradition.

Fuller continues:
"In the perspective of Hobbes's theology, to repose of a mind satisfied can come only with eternal life at the general
resurrection. While the natural condition, which we must still endure in the interim between the first and Second coming
of Christ, prevails, what counts is the inner certainty of the Christian's faith that displaces the pursuit of the
so-called 'highest good' as beside the point... The parallel for politics is clear: pursuing the 'highest good' under
the natural conditions of mankind, will encourage both Pelagianism and anti-nomianism: Pelagianism, because we are
misled into thinking that we can will the human condition to completion — but we cannot; antinomianism, because we are
easily misled into thinking there must be a 'true' or 'correct' political order, accessible to our understanding, which
is distorted or suppressed by the actually prevailing order."

And Voegelin response to this is the claim that Hobbes (and Oakeshott) have mistaken a certain *tendency* always inherent in the
classical/Christian tradition, Gnosticism, for that tradition itself.

An analogy may be helpful here. The classical tradition regards the telos of a round of competitive golf as shooting the
lowest score possible. But it recognizes that, in this world, we will never do so. Nevertheless, we always have that as
our aim, and it directs our efforts during our playing of a round of golf. While we never expect a perfect round, and
therefore do not condemn rounds simply because they fall short of perfection, it provides us a standard by which we may
judge particular rounds more or less exemplary.

The Gnostic, on the other hand, is only satisfied with perfection. Any round with a score higher than 18 is condemned
as sinful and fallen, and any barriers to achieving that perfect round must be obliterated.

It is interesting to note here that, while Voegelin shares Oakeshott's rejection of the "dogmatic metaphysics" of the scholastics,
this does not lead the former as it does the latter to reject teleology, or, indeed, that tradition as a whole. For
instance, Voegelin cites Aquinas as asserting that Christ is "the head of all men," and not just those who have been born
after the birth of Jesus, in order to refute the dogmatic belief that "all mankind that happened to live before Christ"
have been condemned to Hell. (1990a: 78). As he puts it, "it is Thomas Aquinas who considers the Christ to be head of the
*corpus mysticum* that embraces, not only Christians, but all mankind from the creation of the world to its end" (12:
294) And he argues that Anselm's ontological argument is misunderstood if taken as a philosophical "proof" of God's
existence, but that it is, rather, better understood as a meditation or prayer. (1990b: 191-206)

Also of interest is the fact that one of the twentieth century's leading Thomists, Jacques Maritain, held that Thomism
itself is not best understood as dogmatic metaphysics: "Authentic Thomism is not a closed system; it is a wisdom that is
essentially open and without frontiers by the very fact that it is a doctrine in movement and vital development."

In any case, the essential question becomes this: is Hobbes denying the existence of a real *summum bonum*,
or is he dispelling the illusion of a *summum bonum* that does not exist? (There is a third, Straussian possibility:
there is no *summum bonum*, but we ought to act as if there is: the "noble lie.")


## For This Is All a Dream We Dreamed One Afternoon Long Ago

In his brief essay "Leviathan: A Myth," Oakeshott remarks that a civilization is "at bottom a collective dream" (2000:
159). He continues, "What a people dreams in this earthly sleep is it civilization. And the substance of this dream is
a myth, an imaginative interpretation of the human experience, the perception (not the solution) of the mystery of human
life" (2000: 159-160).

This understanding is very close to Voegelin's in *The New Science of Politics*, where he notes that "Human society...
is a whole little world, a cosmion, illuminated with meaning from within by the human beings who continuously create
and bear it as the mode and condition of their self realization" (2000d: 109).

Oakeshott goes on to describe the nature and novelty of the Hobbesian myth:

> The destiny of man is ruled by no Providence, and there is no place in it for perfection, or even lasting
> satisfaction... To those brought up on the older myth [that distinguished medieval Christian civilization], this will
> appear an unduly disenchanted interpretation of the mystery of human life. But there can be no mistaking its character.
> It is myth, not science. It is a perception of mystery, not a pretended solution.  (2000: 162)

## Conclusion

We can now see how, despite their shared view of philosophy as "experience without reservation or arrest," and their
common admiration of Plato, Oakeshott and Voegelin parted ways when it came to the practical value of philosophy. If there *is* a
*summum bonum* that humans can perceive, then philosophy can aid us in identifying it, and orienting our lives towards
it. But if our quest for that highest good is a snark hunt, then pursuing it will only render our practical lives a
hollow effort to capture a phantom. And it is in their differing evaluations of the work of Hobbes that we clearly see
them moving apart.

However, as demonstrated in the penultimate section of this paper, we can perhaps find these two great thinkers reaching
a rapprochement in their understanding that a civilization is grounded in myth. And then the
