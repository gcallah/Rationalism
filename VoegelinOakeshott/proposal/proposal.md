# Book Proposal

## Summary

This book focuses on two twentieth-century thinkers, Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin,
who understood philosophy much as did its Greek founders, as a
search, rather than as a system or a set of conclusions.
Michael Oakeshott and Eric Voegelin. Although not often thought of primarily as philosophers, but more so as
political theorists, each of them regarded himself as a philosopher. And I will demonstrate that
they largely agree on the nature of philosophy.

Neverthless, that basic agreement is followed by a great divergence: for Voegelin, philosophy has vital practical value:
following Plato, it is a discipline for creating right order in the soul, which is the foundation of political order. To
the contrary, Oakeshott sees philosophy as essentially worthless for guiding practical affairs.
This book will also explain from whence arose this parting of the ways.

## Existing Literature

No book length treatment of this topic exists. Timothy Fuller's paper
"Liberalism and the Prospect of Rational Order in Hobbesâ€™s Political Philosophy and the Responses of Oakeshott, Strauss
and Voegelin," which was published in a volume I co-edited, *Tradition v. Rationalism*, is the closest existing work to
this proposed book.
