# Making a Common Muddle

Recently, philosopher Kevin Vallier published an essay
entitled "[Making Common
Cause](https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2021/11/19/making-common-cause/)",
which argues that, "If they ever want to counter the left’s excesses,
neo-nationalists on the right need to ally with classical liberals and embrace
the neutral state."

Vallier contends that both "'woke' progressives and classical liberal defenders
of limited government... oppose national conservatism’s goal of deploying a
muscular state to advance cultural and religious objectives... Their reasons,
however, are very different: Classical liberals disagree with the means
national conservatives deploy because they believe that the state must remain
neutral among competing ends. Progressive liberals, on the other hand, disagree
only with the ends that these conservatives seek..."

And here we discover the first, and most fatal, flaw in Vallier's argument: the
idea that the state *must*, indeed that the state *can*, remain "neutral among
competing ends" is not a serious policy proposal or proposition in political
philosophy: it is a piece of propaganda, under the cover of which "classical
liberalism" conceals the fact that it advances classical liberal ends.

"How so?" you may ask. Well, let us start off with some simpler examples, and
work our way into trickier cases. Imagine a serial killer who insists that, if
classical liberalism is as good as its word, it ought to be neutral among his
end of killing as much as possible and his victims desire to not be killed. What
is the classic liberal state doing sending its armed minions after him? There's
no neutrality in that! Well, at least we post-liberals can answer "Of course
the state is not neutral between evil ends and good ends: the state will
promote the good ends and surpress the evil ones." But Vallier has closed
himself off from that response... as we will see later, he must to a vague
concept of "reasonable ends," a move is a complete failure.

My first example here may appear absurd: "Of course, *everyone* objects to
serial killing!" Well, almost everyone: not serial killers.
But it does start to puncture the silly idea of "liberal neutrality."
However, let's move on to a less outlandish example: imagine an
anarcho-communist confronting the classical liberal state. He contends, along
with Proudhon, that "property is theft." He believes that your seaside villa,
my house in the country, Madison Square Garden, and the Louvre are all the
common property of all mankind: he (and everyone else) ought to be able to
spend the weekend at your villa, farm my land, wander onto the court during a
Knicks game, or borrow the Mona Lisa for a few days for a party. The classical
liberal state is certainly not neutral between his end of everyone sharing
everything in common, and the classical liberal infatuation with the sanctity
of property rights.

Here, we are likely to encounter either some sort of Lockean argument as to how
property rights are just, or perhaps a utilitarian case for why they make us
all wealthier in the long run. But at this point, we are being asked to accept
the classical liberal state either on the basis of Locke's nonsensical
arguments, or to accept the entirely non-neutral end of the state
as maximizing wealth.

Even if one dismisses anarcho-communists as beyond the pale... but at that
point, "neutrality" is starting to appear pretty vacuous... let us go on to
consider Christians who believe the Sabbath should be a day of rest. That was a
principle so widely accepted in the "classical liberal" United States of the
19th-century the blue laws legislating strict limits to what commerce could
occur on a Sunday were ubiquitous. But, in the name of "neutrality," such laws
have been almost entirely overturned. The outcome of that process has not been
"neutral," but, instead, has forced many businesses to remain open on Sundays,
or lose out to their competitors who were willing to remain open. (Max Weber
described this as the "iron cage" in which liberalism trapped individuals.) And
isolated cases like Chick-fil-a, a wildly successful business that has been
able to remain closed on Sundays, hardly show that the average businessman is
not trapped in Weber's iron cage.

Finally, let us consider a devout Muslim resident of a classical liberal state.
She believes that conformance with God's immutable divine law (Sharia) is an
ultimate requirement of a truly just state. She may be willing to deal with a
classical liberal state as a temporary expedient that tolerates Muslims, but
her real end must always be the implementation of Sharia law as the only truly
just form of governance. The classical liberal state is certainly not "neutral"
in regards to her ends.

So, what we have discovered is that, far from being "neutral among competing
ends," the classical liberal state is neutral among competing classical liberal
ends, but will quite definitely squash any
non-liberal ends. And, suddenly, the "classical liberal state" appears in the
daylight, as just another partisan view of what kind of life the state should
favor, just as the communist state is "tolerant" of various communist schemes
for social organization, but intolerant of non-communist ones, or the Catholic
integralist state is tolerant of various intra-Catholic disputes about policy,
but intolerant of positions that undermine the Church's authority.
(Oddly enough, Vallier mentions this contention... and then simply leaves it
unansewred.)

For anyone well-educated in political history, this fact will hardly be
surprising. Most stable polities in history have organized a society around a
particular view of human life, and how that life relates to the cosmos as a
whole. As the political philosopher Eric Voegelin put it, polities are
"cosmions," little shelters that express for their inhabitants how they relate,
through the polity, to the broader cosmos. Their political form "represents"
the inhabitants view of their relationship to the world as a whole. 

When a polity ceases to be "representative" in this cosmic sense, trouble is
afoot:

"If a government is nothing but representative in the constitutional sense, 
a reprpesentative ruler in the existential sense will sooner or later
make an end of it; and quite possibly the new existential ruler will not
be too representative in the constitutional sense." -- NSOP, p. 49

There is, of course, another possibility: a polity will be held together,
despite its failing to be representative in the existential sense, through
force. Thus, for instance, after the collapse of the pagan Roman worldview, the
Roman Empire was sustained for several centuries by military means.
Nevertheless, the Roman emperors were savvy enough to know that finding an
existential representational role for the emperor was desirable, and thus their
experimentation with things like the cult of Sol Invictus, and Constantine's
ultimate choice of Christianity as the "integral" force uniting the empire.

Vallier goes on to try to make hay from the fact that various "nationalist
conservatives" do not agree on every jot and tittle of moral theory and desired
legislation, and that adherents of a number of different religions exist in
this coalition. He contends that:

"Hence the logic of neutrality and toleration unfolds of its own accord.
By accepting neutrality with respect to religion, they must gradually extend
it to morality. And then, by doing so, they have walked right into classical
liberalism's trap."

Here I find myself in complete agreement with Vallier: classical liberalism is,
indeed, a trap. Disguised as "neutral governance," it lures its victims into
Weber's iron cage.

But what is this "logic" that "unfolds of its own accord"? What Vallier appears
to be saying is, "Look, nationalist conservatives, you've already accepted...
well, *Jews* into your coalition. Certainly now logic demands that you not
reject Satanists and polyamourists, right?"

I'm sorry, but this is absurd: simply because one's tolerance extends to point
X is no reason to demand that it extend even further to point Y. Presumably
Vallier himself has limits to his tolerance: would he enter into a coalition
with white supremacists because they agree with him on some issue or other?

In fact, if Vallier's "logic" were sound, well, then why shouldn't nationalist
conservatives, rather than extending their tolerance to classical liberals,
instead extend their tolerance to progressives?
The two groups could then join together to dispel the myth of liberal
neutrality, which both agree is nonsense!

Since the myth of the "neutral state" is exactly what has led us to the
condition that post-liberals deplore, it is ridiculous to ask
post-liberals to accept that nonsense in order to combat progressives.
In fact, post-liberals should recognize that progressives, while mistaken in
seeking utopian ends, are, in fact, allies in exposing the distinctly
non-neutral nature of the classical liberal state.
