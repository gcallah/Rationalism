# Making a Common Muddle

Recently, philosopher Kevin Vallier published an essay
entitled "[Making Common
Cause](https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2021/11/19/making-common-cause/)",
which argues that, "If they ever want to counter the left’s excesses,
neo-nationalists on the right need to ally with classical liberals and embrace
the neutral state."

Vallier contends that both "'woke' progressives and classical liberal defenders
of limited government... oppose national conservatism’s goal of deploying a
muscular state to advance cultural and religious objectives... Their reasons,
however, are very different: Classical liberals disagree with the means
national conservatives deploy because they believe that the state must remain
neutral among competing ends. Progressive liberals, on the other hand, disagree
only with the ends that these conservatives seek, not the means they would
employ."

And here we discover the first, and most fatal, flaw in Vallier's argument: the
idea that the state *must*, indeed that the state *can*, remain "neutral among
competing ends" is not a serious policy proposal or proposition in political
philosophy: it is a piece of propaganda, under the cover of which "classical
liberalism" conceals the fact that it advances classical liberal ends, and
pretends that it is merely a neutral umpire.

"How so?" you may ask. Well, let us start off with some simpler examples, and
work our way into trickier cases. Imagine a serial killer who insists that, if
classical liberalism is as good as its word, it ought to be neutral among his
end of killing as much as possible and his victims desire to not be killed. What
is the classic liberal state doing sending its armed minions after him? There's
no neutrality in that! Well, at least we post-liberals can answer "Of course
the state is not neutral between evil ends and good ends: the state will
promote the good ends and surpress the evil ones." But Vallier has closed
himself off from that response... as we will see later, he must to a vague
concept of "reasonable ends," a move is a complete failure. He might also make
a Kantian response here involving universalizing one's principles... but that
would demand that all subjects of the liberal state be Kantians (or at least
acquiesce to live under Kantian principles)... and that would hardly make for a
"neutral" state!

My first example here may appear absurd: "Of course, *everyone* objects to
serial killing!" Well, almost everyone: not serial killers.
But it does start to puncture the silly idea of "liberal neutrality."
However, let's move on to a less outlandish example: imagine an
anarcho-communist confronting the classical liberal state. He contends, along
with Proudhon, that "property is theft." He believes that your seaside villa,
my house in the country, Madison Square Garden, and the Louvre are all the
common property of all mankind: he (and everyone else) ought to be able to
spend the weekend at your villa, farm my land, wander onto the court during a
Knicks game, or borrow the Mona Lisa for a few days for a party. The classical
liberal state is certainly not neutral between his end of everyone sharing
everything in common, and the classical liberal infatuation with the sanctity
of property rights.

Here, we are likely to encounter either some sort of Lockean argument as to how
property rights are just, or perhaps a utilitarian case for why they make us
all wealthier in the long run. But at this point, we are being asked to accept
the classical liberal state either on the basis of Locke's nonsensical
arguments (where on one page, God owns all of us, [so that suicide is
forbidden, since God as the ultimate proprietor 
doesn't want his "investment" in his capital goods
(humans) destroyed],  but a few pages later, each
of us owns ourselves), or to accept the entirely non-neutral end of the state
as maximizing wealth. (And here we might note that even a libertarian like
Nozick found Locke's argument that "mixing" one's labor with a natural resource
confers ownership to it to be questionable: if I pee into the sea, do I now own
the sea, or rather, have I not merely dissipated my own effort out into its
vastness?)

Even if one dismisses anarcho-communists as beyond the pale... but at that
point, "neutrality" is starting to appear extremely vacuous... let us go on to
consider Christians who believe the Sabbath should be a day of rest. That was a
principle so widely accepted in the "classical liberal" United States of the
19th-century the blue laws legislating strict limits to what commerce could
occur on a Sunday were ubiquitous. But, in the name of "neutrality," such laws
have been almost entirely overturned. The outcome of that process has not been
"neutral," but, instead, has forced many businesses to remain open on Sundays,
or lose out to their competitors who were willing to remain open. (Max Weber
described this as the "iron cage" in which liberalism trapped individuals.) And
isolated cases like Chick-fil-a, a wildly successful business that has been
able to remain closed on Sundays, hardly show that the average businessman is
not trapped in Weber's iron cage.

Finally, let us consider a devout Muslim resident of a classical liberal state.
She believes that conformance with God's immutable divine law (Sharia) is an
ultimate requirement of a truly just state. She may be willing to deal with a
classical liberal state as a temporary expedient that tolerates Muslims, but
her real end must always be the implementation of Sharia law as the only truly
just form of governance. The classical liberal state is certainly not "neutral"
in regards to her ends.

So, what we have discovered is that, far from being "neutral among competing
ends," the classical liberal state is neutral among competing classical liberal
ends, but will quite definitely squash any
non-liberal ends. And, suddenly, the "classical liberal state" appears in the
daylight, as just another partisan view of what kind of life the state should
favor, just as the communist state is "tolerant" of various communist schemes
for social organization, but intolerant of non-communist ones, or the Catholic
integralist state is tolerant of various intra-Catholic disputes about policy,
but intolerant of positions that undermine the Church's authority.







"If a government is nothing but representative in the constitutional sense, 
a reprpesentative ruler in the existential sense will sooner or later
make an end of it; and quite possibly the new existential ruler will not
be too representative in the constitutional sense." -- NSOP, p. 49
